////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** White is a framework for automating rich client applications based on Win32, WinForms, WPF, Silverlight and SWT (Java) platforms. 其中對 Silverlight 的支援最弱
** It is .NET based and does not require the use of any proprietary scripting languages. （事實上，只能用 .NET languages，至於 Python 就得用 IronPython??） Tests/automation programs using White can be written with whatever .NET language, IDE and tools you are already using.
** White provides a consistent object-oriented API, hiding the complexity of Microsoft's UIAutomation library (on which White is based) and windows messages.
** At runtime white programs stack would look like this. White programs must run in a different process from the AUT (Application Under Test) process. (圖) 程式只會接觸到 White Core，背後主要是用 UI Automation 跟 .NET 3 Runtime。
** https://uiautomationverify.codeplex.com/ is an essential tool when working with White, it can give you a lot of information about the application you are trying to automate 它似乎已併入成為 Windows SDK 中 Testing Tools 的一員 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj160544(v=vs.85).aspx[Visual UI Automation Verify (Windows)]
** White is a library which expects it's consumers to have development skills. A recorder is no longer provided, so it is recommended testers with no development experience work with developers to use White, or look for another tool which is geared more towards testers directly.
** White works on top of UIAutomation framework of .Net. If you intend to or have third party controls in your application, you should verify whether they these controls are supported by UIA.
** White does support Win32, WPF, WinForm, SWT and Silverlight applications. In fact SWT is a type of Win32 application when running on windows. Powerbuilder, MFC, etc applications are all Win32 applications as well. In order to determine which controls are automatable, please use UISpy or UIAutomationVerify to check whether these controls are visible using MS UIAutomation. White is based on UIAutomation framework. 很快地檢查 UI Automation 可否存取得到要驗證的資訊或操作的部份
** White uses the UI Automation API (UIA) to find controls on a window. UIA communicates to a displayed window via window messages. This find is performed by iterating through all the controls in a window. This can be slow for windows which have a lot of UIItems.
** White supports position-based caching of UIItem find results to improve performance. Speed up performance by Position based search WithCache creates a cache of PrimaryUIItems. This cache is not meant to be used directly by automation programs. ??
** Finding a UI Item and performing action: `Button button = window.Get<Button>("save"); button.Click();`
** Finding a UIItem based on `SearchCriteria`: `SearchCriteria searchCriteria = SearchCriteria.ByAutomationId("name").AndControlType(typeof(TextBox)).AndIndex(2); TextBox textBox = (TextBox) window.Get(searchCriteria); textBox.Text = "Anil";`
** Architecture (圖)
** Silverlight Support 打開 IE 直接拿取 sliverlight document，之後的操作就很一般了

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
InternetExplorerWindow browserWindow = InternetExplorer.Launch("http://localhost/white.testsilverlight/TestSilverlightApplicationTestPage.aspx", "FooApp Title - Windows Internet Explorer");
SilverlightDocument document = browserWindow.SilverlightDocument;
Button button = document.Get<Button>("buton");
Label label = document.Get<Label>("status");

** NOTE: Silverlight support is not tested, and likely has many issues. I am considering dropping Silverlight support unless members of the Community improve test coverage of the Silverlight support in White I recommend checking out Coded UI for Silverlight http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2010/11/24/coded-ui-available-for-silverlight-4.aspx 或許是 Sliverlight 很少人在用?
