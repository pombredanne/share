__Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and ''acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)''. It has easy-to-use ''tabular test data syntax'' and utilizes the ''keyword-driven'' testing approach. Its testing capabilities can be extended by test libraries implemented either with Python or Java, and users can create new keywords from existing ones using the same syntax that is used for creating test cases.__

Robot Framework is open source software released under Apache License 2.0. Its copyrights are owned and development supported by Nokia Siemens Networks.

'''Features'''

 * Enables easy-to-use tabular syntax for creating test cases in a uniform way.

 * __Allows using keyword-driven, data-driven and behavior-driven (BDD) approaches.__

 * Provides ability to create reusable higher-level keywords from the existing keywords.

 * Provides easy-to-read reports and logs in HTML format.

 * Is platform and application independent.

 * __The modular architecture supports creating tests even for applications with several diverse interfaces.__

 * Provides a simple library API for creating customized test libraries.

 * __Provides a command line interface and XML based outputs for integration into existing build infrastructure (continuous integration systems).__

 * Provides support for Selenium for web testing, Java GUI testing, running processes, Telnet, SSH, and so on.

 * __Remote library interface enables distributed testing and implementing test libraries in any programming language.__

 * __Provides tagging to categorize and select test cases to be executed.__

 * Has built-in support for variables, practical particularly for testing in different environments.

Robot Framework Quick Start Guide introduces the most important features of the framework and acts also as an executable demo. Before executing it, you need to have Robot Framework installed. All the features are explained in detail in the Robot Framework User Guide.

The guide, and everything needed to run it as a demo, is available through the download page as a separate ZIP package. All this material is also included in source distributions (in `doc/quickstart` directory) which are also available from the download page. Additionally, the latest version of the guide is always available for viewing online.

To see another demo using Robot Framework, take a look at SeleniumLibrary and SwingLibrary.
