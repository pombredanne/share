   The Number One HTTP Server On The Internet

     The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain
     an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including
     UNIX and Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a
     secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services
     in sync with the current HTTP standards.

     Apache httpd has been the most popular web server on the Internet
     since April 1996, and celebrated its 15th birthday as a project this
     February.

     The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") is a project of The Apache Software
     Foundation.

   Apache HTTP Server 2.2.15 Released                        2010-03-06

     The Apache HTTP Server Project is proud to announce the release of
     version 2.2.15 of the Apache HTTP Server ("httpd"). This version is
     principally a security and bugfix release.

     Notably, this release was updated to reflect the OpenSSL Project's
     release 0.9.8m of the openssl library, and addresses CVE-2009-3555
     (cve.mitre.org), the TLS renegotiation prefix injection attack. This
     release further addresses the issues CVE-2010-0408, CVE-2010-0425
     and CVE-2010-0434 within mod_proxy_ajp, mod_isapi and mod_headers
     respectively.

     This version of httpd is a major release and the start of a new
     stable branch, and represents the best available version of Apache
     HTTP Server. New features include Smart Filtering, Improved Caching,
     AJP Proxy, Proxy Load Balancing, Graceful Shutdown support, Large
     File Support, the Event MPM, and refactored
     Authentication/Authorization.

     The Apache HTTP Server Project is proud to announce the release of
     version 2.3.5-alpha of the Apache HTTP Server ("httpd"). This
     version of httpd is principally an Alpha release to test new
     technology and features that are incompatible or too large for the

     compatible with binaries built against any prior or future version..

     New features include Loadable MPMs, major improvements to OSCP

     Object Caching API.
