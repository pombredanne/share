=== The Number One HTTP Server On The Internet ===

The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards.

__Apache httpd has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996, and celebrated its 15th birthday as a project this February.__

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") is a project of The Apache Software Foundation.
