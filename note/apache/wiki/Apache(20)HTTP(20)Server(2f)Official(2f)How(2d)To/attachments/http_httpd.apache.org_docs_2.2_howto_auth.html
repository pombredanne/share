Authentication, Authorization and Access Control

   Available Languages: [12] en  | [13] ja  | [14] ko

   Authentication is any process by which you verify that someone is who
   they claim they are. Authorization is any process by which someone is
   allowed to be where they want to go, or to have information that they
   want to have.

Related Modules and Directives

   There are three types of modules involved in the authentication and
   authorization process. You will usually need to choose at least one
   module from each group.
     * Authentication type (see the [24]AuthType directive)
          + [25]mod_auth_basic
          + [26]mod_auth_digest
     * Authentication provider
          + [27]mod_authn_alias
          + [28]mod_authn_anon
          + [29]mod_authn_dbd
          + [30]mod_authn_dbm
          + [31]mod_authn_default
          + [32]mod_authn_file
          + [33]mod_authnz_ldap
     * Authorization (see the [34]Require directive)
          + [35]mod_authnz_ldap
          + [36]mod_authz_dbm
          + [37]mod_authz_default
          + [38]mod_authz_groupfile
          + [39]mod_authz_owner
          + [40]mod_authz_user

   The module [41]mod_authnz_ldap is both an authentication and
   authorization provider. The module [42]mod_authn_alias is not an
   authentication provider in itself, but allows other authentication
   providers to be configured in a flexible manner.

   The module [43]mod_authz_host provides authorization and access control
   based on hostname, IP address or characteristics of the request, but is
   not part of the authentication provider system.

   You probably also want to take a look at the [44]Access Control howto,
   which discusses the various ways to control access to your server.

Introduction

   If you have information on your web site that is sensitive or intended
   for only a small group of people, the techniques in this article will
   help you make sure that the people that see those pages are the people
   that you wanted to see them.

   This article covers the "standard" way of protecting parts of your web
   site that most of you are going to use.

Note:

   If your data really needs to be secure, consider using [46]mod_ssl in
   addition to any authentication.
   [47]top

The Prerequisites

   The directives discussed in this article will need to go either in your
   main server configuration file (typically in a [48]<Directory>
   section), or in per-directory configuration files (.htaccess files).

   If you plan to use .htaccess files, you will need to have a server
   configuration that permits putting authentication directives in these
   files. This is done with the [49]AllowOverride directive, which
   specifies which directives, if any, may be put in per-directory
   configuration files.

   Since we're talking here about authentication, you will need an
   [50]AllowOverride directive like the following:

   AllowOverride AuthConfig

   Or, if you are just going to put the directives directly in your main
   server configuration file, you will of course need to have write
   permission to that file.

   And you'll need to know a little bit about the directory structure of
   your server, in order to know where some files are kept. This should
   not be terribly difficult, and I'll try to make this clear when we come
   to that point.
   [51]top

Getting it working

   Here's the basics of password protecting a directory on your server.

   First, you need to create a password file. Exactly how you do this will
   vary depending on what authentication provider you have chosen. More on
   that later. To start with, we'll use a text password file.

   This file should be placed somewhere not accessible from the web. This
   is so that folks cannot download the password file. For example, if
   your documents are served out of /usr/local/apache/htdocs you might
   want to put the password file(s) in /usr/local/apache/passwd.

   To create the file, use the [52]htpasswd utility that came with Apache.
   This will be located in the bin directory of wherever you installed
   Apache. If you have installed Apache from a third-party package, it may
   be in your execution path.

   To create the file, type:

   htpasswd -c /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords rbowen

   [53]htpasswd will ask you for the password, and then ask you to type it
   again to confirm it:

   # htpasswd -c /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords rbowen
   New password: mypassword
   Re-type new password: mypassword
   Adding password for user rbowen

   If [54]htpasswd is not in your path, of course you'll have to type the
   full path to the file to get it to run. With a default installation,
   it's located at /usr/local/apache2/bin/htpasswd

   Next, you'll need to configure the server to request a password and
   tell the server which users are allowed access. You can do this either
   by editing the httpd.conf file or using an .htaccess file. For example,
   if you wish to protect the directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/secret,
   you can use the following directives, either placed in the file
   /usr/local/apache/htdocs/secret/.htaccess, or placed in httpd.conf
   inside a <Directory /usr/local/apache/apache/htdocs/secret> section.

   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "Restricted Files"
   # (Following line optional)
   AuthBasicProvider file
   AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords
   Require user rbowen

   Let's examine each of those directives individually. The [55]AuthType
   directive selects that method that is used to authenticate the user.
   The most common method is Basic, and this is the method implemented by
   [56]mod_auth_basic. It is important to be aware, however, that Basic
   authentication sends the password from the client to the server
   unencrypted. This method should therefore not be used for highly
   sensitive data, unless accompanied by [57]mod_ssl. Apache supports one
   other authentication method: AuthType Digest. This method is
   implemented by [58]mod_auth_digest and is much more secure. Most recent
   browsers support Digest authentication.

   The [59]AuthName directive sets the Realm to be used in the
   authentication. The realm serves two major functions. First, the client
   often presents this information to the user as part of the password
   dialog box. Second, it is used by the client to determine what password
   to send for a given authenticated area.

   So, for example, once a client has authenticated in the "Restricted
   Files" area, it will automatically retry the same password for any area
   on the same server that is marked with the "Restricted Files" Realm.
   Therefore, you can prevent a user from being prompted more than once
   for a password by letting multiple restricted areas share the same
   realm. Of course, for security reasons, the client will always need to
   ask again for the password whenever the hostname of the server changes.

   The [60]AuthBasicProvider is, in this case, optional, since file is the
   default value for this directive. You'll need to use this directive if
   you are choosing a different source for authentication, such as
   [61]mod_authn_dbm or [62]mod_authn_dbd.

   The [63]AuthUserFile directive sets the path to the password file that
   we just created with [64]htpasswd. If you have a large number of users,
   it can be quite slow to search through a plain text file to
   authenticate the user on each request. Apache also has the ability to
   store user information in fast database files. The [65]mod_authn_dbm
   module provides the [66]AuthDBMUserFile directive. These files can be
   created and manipulated with the [67]dbmmanage program. Many other
   types of authentication options are available from third party modules
   in the [68]Apache Modules Database.

   Finally, the [69]Require directive provides the authorization part of
   the process by setting the user that is allowed to access this region
   of the server. In the next section, we discuss various ways to use the
   [70]Require directive.
   [71]top

Letting more than one person in

   The directives above only let one person (specifically someone with a
   username of rbowen) into the directory. In most cases, you'll want to
   let more than one person in. This is where the [72]AuthGroupFile comes
   in.

   If you want to let more than one person in, you'll need to create a
   group file that associates group names with a list of users in that
   group. The format of this file is pretty simple, and you can create it
   with your favorite editor. The contents of the file will look like
   this:

   GroupName: rbowen dpitts sungo rshersey

   That's just a list of the members of the group in a long line separated
   by spaces.

   To add a user to your already existing password file, type:

   htpasswd /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords dpitts

   You'll get the same response as before, but it will be appended to the
   existing file, rather than creating a new file. (It's the -c that makes
   it create a new password file).

   Now, you need to modify your .htaccess file to look like the following:

   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "By Invitation Only"
   # Optional line:
   AuthBasicProvider file
   AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords
   AuthGroupFile /usr/local/apache/passwd/groups
   Require group GroupName

   Now, anyone that is listed in the group GroupName, and has an entry in
   the password file, will be let in, if they type the correct password.

   There's another way to let multiple users in that is less specific.
   Rather than creating a group file, you can just use the following
   directive:

   Require valid-user

   Using that rather than the Require user rbowen line will allow anyone
   in that is listed in the password file, and who correctly enters their
   password. You can even emulate the group behavior here, by just keeping
   a separate password file for each group. The advantage of this approach
   is that Apache only has to check one file, rather than two. The
   disadvantage is that you have to maintain a bunch of password files,
   and remember to reference the right one in the [73]AuthUserFile
   directive.
   [74]top

Possible problems

   Because of the way that Basic authentication is specified, your
   username and password must be verified every time you request a
   document from the server. This is even if you're reloading the same
   page, and for every image on the page (if they come from a protected
   directory). As you can imagine, this slows things down a little. The
   amount that it slows things down is proportional to the size of the
   password file, because it has to open up that file, and go down the
   list of users until it gets to your name. And it has to do this every
   time a page is loaded.

   A consequence of this is that there's a practical limit to how many
   users you can put in one password file. This limit will vary depending
   on the performance of your particular server machine, but you can
   expect to see slowdowns once you get above a few hundred entries, and
   may wish to consider a different authentication method at that time.
   [75]top

Alternate password storage

   Because storing passwords in plain text files has the above problems,
   you may wish to store your passwords somewhere else, such as in a
   database.

   [76]mod_authn_dbm and [77]mod_authn_dbd are two modules which make this
   possible. Rather than selecting [78]AuthBasicProvider file, instead you
   can choose dbm or dbd as your storage format.

   To select a dbd file rather than a text file, for example:

   <Directory /www/docs/private>
   AuthName "Private"
   AuthType Basic
   AuthBasicProvider dbm
   AuthDBMUserFile /www/passwords/passwd.dbm
   Require valid-user </Directory>

   Other options are available. Consult the [79]mod_authn_dbm
   documentation for more details.
   [80]top

More information

   You should also read the documentation for [81]mod_auth_basic and
   [82]mod_authz_host which contain some more information about how this
   all works. [83]mod_authn_alias can also help in simplifying certain
   authentication configurations.

   The various ciphers supported by Apache for authentication data are
   explained in [84]Password Encryptions.

   And you may want to look at the [85]Access Control howto, which
   discusses a number of related topics.
