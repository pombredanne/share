 * Description: Provides for mapping different parts of the host filesystem in the document tree and for URL redirection
 * Status: Base
 * Module Identifier: `alias_module`
 * Source File: `mod_alias.c`

== Summary ==

The directives contained in this module allow for manipulation and control of URLs as requests arrive at the server. __The `Alias` and `ScriptAlias` directives are used to map between URLs and filesystem paths. This allows for content which is not directly under the `DocumentRoot` served as part of the web document tree. The `ScriptAlias` directive has the additional effect of marking the target directory as containing only CGI scripts.__

__The `Redirect` directives are used to instruct clients to make a new request with a different URL. They are often used when a resource has moved to a new location.__

__`mod_alias` is designed to handle simple URL manipulation tasks. For more complicated tasks such as manipulating the query string, use the tools provided by `mod_rewrite`.__
