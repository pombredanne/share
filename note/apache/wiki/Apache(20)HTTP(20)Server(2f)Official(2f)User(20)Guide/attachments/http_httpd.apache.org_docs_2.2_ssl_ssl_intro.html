SSL/TLS Strong Encryption: An Introduction

   Available Languages: [12] en  | [13] ja

     The nice thing about standards is that there are so many to choose
     from. And if you really don't like all the standards you just have
     to wait another year until the one arises you are looking for.

     -- A. Tanenbaum, "Introduction to Computer Networks"

   As an introduction this chapter is aimed at readers who are familiar
   with the Web, HTTP, and Apache, but are not security experts. It is not
   intended to be a definitive guide to the SSL protocol, nor does it
   discuss specific techniques for managing certificates in an
   organization, or the important legal issues of patents and import and
   export restrictions. Rather, it is intended to provide a common
   background to [14]mod_ssl users by pulling together various concepts,
   definitions, and examples as a starting point for further exploration.

   The presented content is mainly derived, with the author's permission,
   from the article [15]Introducing SSL and Certificates using SSLeay by
   [16]Frederick J. Hirsch, of The Open Group Research Institute, which
   was published in [17]Web Security: A Matter of Trust, World Wide Web
   Journal, Volume 2, Issue 3, Summer 1997. Please send any positive

Cryptographic Techniques

   Understanding SSL requires an understanding of cryptographic
   algorithms, message digest functions (aka. one-way or hash functions),
   and digital signatures. These techniques are the subject of entire
   books (see for instance [[26]AC96]) and provide the basis for privacy,
   integrity, and authentication.

Cryptographic Algorithms

   Suppose Alice wants to send a message to her bank to transfer some
   money. Alice would like the message to be private, since it will
   include information such as her account number and transfer amount. One
   solution is to use a cryptographic algorithm, a technique that would
   transform her message into an encrypted form, unreadable until it is
   decrypted. Once in this form, the message can only be decrypted by
   using a secret key. Without the key the message is useless: good
   cryptographic algorithms make it so difficult for intruders to decode
   the original text that it isn't worth their effort.

   There are two categories of cryptographic algorithms: conventional and
   public key.

   Conventional cryptography
          also known as symmetric cryptography, requires the sender and
          receiver to share a key: a secret piece of information that may
          be used to encrypt or decrypt a message. As long as this key is
          kept secret, nobody other than the sender or recipient can read
          the message. If Alice and the bank know a secret key, then they
          can send each other private messages. The task of sharing a key
          between sender and recipient before communicating, while also
          keeping it secret from others, can be problematic.

   Public key cryptography
          also known as asymmetric cryptography, solves the key exchange
          problem by defining an algorithm which uses two keys, each of
          which may be used to encrypt a message. If one key is used to
          encrypt a message then the other must be used to decrypt it.
          This makes it possible to receive secure messages by simply
          publishing one key (the public key) and keeping the other secret
          (the private key).

   Anyone can encrypt a message using the public key, but only the owner
   of the private key will be able to read it. In this way, Alice can send
   private messages to the owner of a key-pair (the bank), by encrypting
   them using their public key. Only the bank will be able to decrypt
   them.

Message Digests

   Although Alice may encrypt her message to make it private, there is
   still a concern that someone might modify her original message or
   substitute it with a different one, in order to transfer the money to
   themselves, for instance. One way of guaranteeing the integrity of
   Alice's message is for her to create a concise summary of her message
   and send this to the bank as well. Upon receipt of the message, the
   bank creates its own summary and compares it with the one Alice sent.
   If the summaries are the same then the message has been received
   intact.

   A summary such as this is called a message digest, one-way function or
   hash function. Message digests are used to create a short, fixed-length
   representation of a longer, variable-length message. Digest algorithms
   are designed to produce a unique digest for each message. Message
   digests are designed to make it impractically difficult to determine
   the message from the digest and (in theory) impossible to find two
   different messages which create the same digest -- thus eliminating the
   possibility of substituting one message for another while maintaining
   the same digest.

   Another challenge that Alice faces is finding a way to send the digest
   to the bank securely; if the digest is not sent securely, its integrity
   may be compromised and with it the possibility for the bank to
   determine the integrity of the original message. Only if the digest is
   sent securely can the integrity of the associated message be
   determined.

   One way to send the digest securely is to include it in a digital
   signature.

Digital Signatures

   When Alice sends a message to the bank, the bank needs to ensure that
   the message is really from her, so an intruder cannot request a
   transaction involving her account. A digital signature, created by
   Alice and included with the message, serves this purpose.

   Digital signatures are created by encrypting a digest of the message
   and other information (such as a sequence number) with the sender's
   private key. Though anyone can decrypt the signature using the public
   key, only the sender knows the private key. This means that only the
   sender can have signed the message. Including the digest in the
   signature means the signature is only good for that message; it also
   ensures the integrity of the message since no one can change the digest
   and still sign it.

   To guard against interception and reuse of the signature by an intruder
   at a later date, the signature contains a unique sequence number. This
   protects the bank from a fraudulent claim from Alice that she did not
   send the message -- only she could have signed it (non-repudiation).
   [27]top

Certificates

   Although Alice could have sent a private message to the bank, signed it
   and ensured the integrity of the message, she still needs to be sure
   that she is really communicating with the bank. This means that she
   needs to be sure that the public key she is using is part of the bank's
   key-pair, and not an intruder's. Similarly, the bank needs to verify
   that the message signature really was signed by the private key that
   belongs to Alice.

   If each party has a certificate which validates the other's identity,
   confirms the public key and is signed by a trusted agency, then both
   can be assured that they are communicating with whom they think they
   are. Such a trusted agency is called a Certificate Authority and
   certificates are used for authentication.

Certificate Contents

   A certificate associates a public key with the real identity of an
   individual, server, or other entity, known as the subject. As shown in
   [28]Table 1, information about the subject includes identifying
   information (the distinguished name) and the public key. It also
   includes the identification and signature of the Certificate Authority
   that issued the certificate and the period of time during which the
   certificate is valid. It may have additional information (or
   extensions) as well as administrative information for the Certificate
   Authority's use, such as a serial number.

Table 1: Certificate Information

            Subject           Distinguished Name, Public Key
             Issuer           Distinguished Name, Signature
       Period of Validity     Not Before Date, Not After Date
   Administrative Information Version, Serial Number
      Extended Information    Basic Constraints, Netscape Flags, etc.

   A distinguished name is used to provide an identity in a specific
   context -- for instance, an individual might have a personal
   certificate as well as one for their identity as an employee.
   Distinguished names are defined by the X.509 standard [[29]X509], which
   defines the fields, field names and abbreviations used to refer to the
   fields (see [30]Table 2).

Table 2: Distinguished Name Information

   DN Field Abbrev. Description Example
   Common Name CN Name being certified CN=Joe Average
   Organization or Company O Name is associated with this
   organization O=Snake Oil, Ltd.
   Organizational Unit OU Name is associated with this
   organization unit, such as a department OU=Research Institute
   City/Locality L Name is located in this City L=Snake City
   State/Province ST Name is located in this State/Province ST=Desert
   Country C Name is located in this Country (ISO code) C=XZ

   A Certificate Authority may define a policy specifying which
   distinguished field names are optional and which are required. It may
   also place requirements upon the field contents, as may users of
   certificates. For example, a Netscape browser requires that the Common
   Name for a certificate representing a server matches a wildcard pattern
   for the domain name of that server, such as *.snakeoil.com.

   The binary format of a certificate is defined using the ASN.1 notation
   [[31]X208] [[32]PKCS]. This notation defines how to specify the
   contents and encoding rules define how this information is translated
   into binary form. The binary encoding of the certificate is defined
   using Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER), which are based on the more
   general Basic Encoding Rules (BER). For those transmissions which
   cannot handle binary, the binary form may be translated into an ASCII
   form by using Base64 encoding [[33]MIME]. When placed between begin and
   end delimiter lines (as below), this encoded version is called a PEM
   ("Privacy Enhanced Mail") encoded certificate.

Example of a PEM-encoded certificate (snakeoil.crt)

Certificate Authorities

   By verifying the information in a certificate request before granting
   the certificate, the Certificate Authority assures itself of the
   identity of the private key owner of a key-pair. For instance, if Alice
   requests a personal certificate, the Certificate Authority must first
   make sure that Alice really is the person the certificate request
   claims she is.

Certificate Chains

   A Certificate Authority may also issue a certificate for another
   Certificate Authority. When examining a certificate, Alice may need to
   examine the certificate of the issuer, for each parent Certificate
   Authority, until reaching one which she has confidence in. She may
   decide to trust only certificates with a limited chain of issuers, to
   reduce her risk of a "bad" certificate in the chain.

Creating a Root-Level CA

   As noted earlier, each certificate requires an issuer to assert the
   validity of the identity of the certificate subject, up to the
   top-level Certificate Authority (CA). This presents a problem: who can
   vouch for the certificate of the top-level authority, which has no
   issuer? In this unique case, the certificate is "self-signed", so the
   issuer of the certificate is the same as the subject. Browsers are
   preconfigured to trust well-known certificate authorities, but it is
   important to exercise extra care in trusting a self-signed certificate.
   The wide publication of a public key by the root authority reduces the
   risk in trusting this key -- it would be obvious if someone else
   publicized a key claiming to be the authority.

   A number of companies, such as [34]Thawte and [35]VeriSign have
   established themselves as Certificate Authorities. These companies
   provide the following services:
     * Verifying certificate requests
     * Processing certificate requests
     * Issuing and managing certificates

   It is also possible to create your own Certificate Authority. Although
   risky in the Internet environment, it may be useful within an Intranet
   where the organization can easily verify the identities of individuals
   and servers.

Certificate Management

   Establishing a Certificate Authority is a responsibility which requires
   a solid administrative, technical and management framework. Certificate
   Authorities not only issue certificates, they also manage them -- that
   is, they determine for how long certificates remain valid, they renew
   them and keep lists of certificates that were issued in the past but
   are no longer valid (Certificate Revocation Lists, or CRLs).

   For example, if Alice is entitled to a certificate as an employee of a
   company but has now left that company, her certificate may need to be
   revoked. Because certificates are only issued after the subject's
   identity has been verified and can then be passed around to all those
   with whom the subject may communicate, it is impossible to tell from
   the certificate alone that it has been revoked. Therefore when
   examining certificates for validity it is necessary to contact the
   issuing Certificate Authority to check CRLs -- this is usually not an
   automated part of the process.

Note

   If you use a Certificate Authority that browsers are not configured to
   trust by default, it is necessary to load the Certificate Authority
   certificate into the browser, enabling the browser to validate server
   certificates signed by that Certificate Authority. Doing so may be
   dangerous, since once loaded, the browser will accept all certificates
   signed by that Certificate Authority.

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

   The Secure Sockets Layer protocol is a protocol layer which may be
   placed between a reliable connection-oriented network layer protocol
   (e.g. TCP/IP) and the application protocol layer (e.g. HTTP). SSL
   provides for secure communication between client and server by allowing
   mutual authentication, the use of digital signatures for integrity and
   encryption for privacy.

   The protocol is designed to support a range of choices for specific
   algorithms used for cryptography, digests and signatures. This allows
   algorithm selection for specific servers to be made based on legal,
   export or other concerns and also enables the protocol to take
   advantage of new algorithms. Choices are negotiated between client and
   server when establishing a protocol session.

Table 4: Versions of the SSL protocol

   Version Source Description Browser Support
   SSL v2.0 Vendor Standard (from Netscape Corp.) [[37]SSL2] First SSL
   protocol for which implementations exist - NS Navigator 1.x/2.x
   - MS IE 3.x
   - Lynx/2.8+OpenSSL
   SSL v3.0 Expired Internet Draft (from Netscape Corp.) [[38]SSL3]
   Revisions to prevent specific security attacks, add non-RSA ciphers and
   support for certificate chains - NS Navigator 2.x/3.x/4.x
   - MS IE 3.x/4.x
   - Lynx/2.8+OpenSSL
   TLS v1.0 Proposed Internet Standard (from IETF) [[39]TLS1] Revision of
   SSL 3.0 to update the MAC layer to HMAC, add block padding for block
   ciphers, message order standardization and more alert messages. -
   Lynx/2.8+OpenSSL

   There are a number of versions of the SSL protocol, as shown in
   [40]Table 4. As noted there, one of the benefits in SSL 3.0 is that it
   adds support of certificate chain loading. This feature allows a server
   to pass a server certificate along with issuer certificates to the
   browser. Chain loading also permits the browser to validate the server
   certificate, even if Certificate Authority certificates are not
   installed for the intermediate issuers, since they are included in the
   certificate chain. SSL 3.0 is the basis for the Transport Layer
   Security [[41]TLS] protocol standard, currently in development by the
   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

Establishing a Session

   The SSL session is established by following a handshake sequence
   between client and server, as shown in [42]Figure 1. This sequence may
   vary, depending on whether the server is configured to provide a server
   certificate or request a client certificate. Although cases exist where
   additional handshake steps are required for management of cipher
   information, this article summarizes one common scenario. See the SSL
   specification for the full range of possibilities.

Note

   Once an SSL session has been established, it may be reused. This avoids
   the performance penalty of repeating the many steps needed to start a
   session. To do this, the server assigns each SSL session a unique
   session identifier which is cached in the server and which the client
   can use in future connections to reduce the handshake time (until the
   session identifer expires from the cache of the server).

   Figure 1: Simplified SSL Handshake Sequence

   The elements of the handshake sequence, as used by the client and
   server, are listed below:
    1. Negotiate the Cipher Suite to be used during data transfer
    2. Establish and share a session key between client and server
    3. Optionally authenticate the server to the client
    4. Optionally authenticate the client to the server

   The first step, Cipher Suite Negotiation, allows the client and server
   to choose a Cipher Suite supported by both of them. The SSL3.0 protocol
   specification defines 31 Cipher Suites. A Cipher Suite is defined by
   the following components:
     * Key Exchange Method
     * Cipher for Data Transfer
     * Message Digest for creating the Message Authentication Code (MAC)

   These three elements are described in the sections that follow.

Key Exchange Method

   The key exchange method defines how the shared secret symmetric
   cryptography key used for application data transfer will be agreed upon
   by client and server. SSL 2.0 uses RSA key exchange only, while SSL 3.0
   supports a choice of key exchange algorithms including RSA key exchange
   (when certificates are used), and Diffie-Hellman key exchange (for
   exchanging keys without certificates, or without prior communication
   between client and server).

   One variable in the choice of key exchange methods is digital
   signatures -- whether or not to use them, and if so, what kind of
   signatures to use. Signing with a private key provides protection
   against a man-in-the-middle-attack during the information exchange used
   to generating the shared key [[43]AC96, p516].

Cipher for Data Transfer

   SSL uses conventional symmetric cryptography, as described earlier, for
   encrypting messages in a session. There are nine choices of how to
   encrypt, including the option not to encrypt:
     * No encryption
     * Stream Ciphers
          + RC4 with 40-bit keys
          + RC4 with 128-bit keys
     * CBC Block Ciphers
          + RC2 with 40 bit key
          + DES with 40 bit key
          + DES with 56 bit key
          + Triple-DES with 168 bit key
          + Idea (128 bit key)
          + Fortezza (96 bit key)

   "CBC" refers to Cipher Block Chaining, which means that a portion of
   the previously encrypted cipher text is used in the encryption of the
   current block. "DES" refers to the Data Encryption Standard [[44]AC96,
   ch12], which has a number of variants (including DES40 and 3DES_EDE).
   "Idea" is currently one of the best and cryptographically strongest
   algorithms available, and "RC2" is a proprietary algorithm from RSA DSI
   [[45]AC96, ch13].

Digest Function

   The choice of digest function determines how a digest is created from a
   record unit. SSL supports the following:
     * No digest (Null choice)
     * MD5, a 128-bit hash
     * Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1), a 160-bit hash

   The message digest is used to create a Message Authentication Code
   (MAC) which is encrypted with the message to verify integrity and to
   protect against replay attacks.

Handshake Sequence Protocol

   The handshake sequence uses three protocols:
     * The SSL Handshake Protocol for performing the client and server SSL
       session establishment.
     * The SSL Change Cipher Spec Protocol for actually establishing
       agreement on the Cipher Suite for the session.
     * The SSL Alert Protocol for conveying SSL error messages between
       client and server.

   These protocols, as well as application protocol data, are encapsulated
   in the SSL Record Protocol, as shown in [46]Figure 2. An encapsulated
   protocol is transferred as data by the lower layer protocol, which does
   not examine the data. The encapsulated protocol has no knowledge of the
   underlying protocol.

   Figure 2: SSL Protocol Stack

   The encapsulation of SSL control protocols by the record protocol means
   that if an active session is renegotiated the control protocols will be
   transmitted securely. If there was no previous session, the Null cipher
   suite is used, which means there will be no encryption and messages
   will have no integrity digests, until the session has been established.

Data Transfer

   The SSL Record Protocol, shown in [47]Figure 3, is used to transfer
   application and SSL Control data between the client and server, where
   necessary fragmenting this data into smaller units, or combining
   multiple higher level protocol data messages into single units. It may
   compress, attach digest signatures, and encrypt these units before
   transmitting them using the underlying reliable transport protocol
   (Note: currently, no major SSL implementations include support for
   compression).

   Figure 3: SSL Record Protocol

Securing HTTP Communication

   One common use of SSL is to secure Web HTTP communication between a
   browser and a webserver. This does not preclude the use of non-secured
   HTTP - the secure version (called HTTPS) is the same as plain HTTP over
   SSL, but uses the URL scheme https rather than http, and a different
   server port (by default, port 443). This functionality is a large part
   of what [48]mod_ssl provides for the Apache webserver.
