Apache Virtual Host documentation

   Available Languages:  de  |  en  |  fr  |  ja  |  ko  |  ru  |  tr

   The term Virtual Host refers to the practice of running more than one
   web site (such as www.company1.com and www.company2.com) on a single
   machine. Virtual hosts can be "IP-based", meaning that you have a
   different IP address for every web site, or "name-based", meaning that
   you have multiple names running on each IP address. The fact that they
   are running on the same physical server is not apparent to the end
   user.

   Apache was one of the first servers to support IP-based virtual hosts
   right out of the box. Versions 1.1 and later of Apache support both
   IP-based and name-based virtual hosts (vhosts). The latter variant of
   virtual hosts is sometimes also called host-based or non-IP virtual
   hosts.

   Below is a list of documentation pages which explain all details of
   virtual host support in Apache version 1.3 and later.
     * Virtual Host Support
     * Configuration directives

Virtual Host Support

     * Name-based Virtual Hosts (More than one web site per IP address)
     * IP-based Virtual Hosts (An IP address for each web site)
     * Virtual Host examples for common setups
     * File Descriptor Limits (or, Too many log files)
     * Dynamically Configured Mass Virtual Hosting

Configuration directives

     * <VirtualHost>
     * NameVirtualHost
     * ServerName
     * ServerAlias
     * ServerPath

   If you are trying to debug your virtual host configuration, you may
   find the Apache -S command line switch useful. That is, type the
   following command:

   /usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd -S

   This command will dump out a description of how Apache parsed the
   configuration file. Careful examination of the IP addresses and server
   names may help uncover configuration mistakes. (See the docs for the
   httpd program for other command line options)
