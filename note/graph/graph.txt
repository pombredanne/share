////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a graph is a representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by mathematical abstractions called vertices, and the links that connect some pairs of vertices are called edges. (從連接不同的點來看，說這中間的連結是 edge 並不奇怪) Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges.
** The edges may be directed or undirected. 有方向性，通常用箭頭來表示
** Vertices are also called nodes or points, and edges are also called lines or arcs. 不知道為什麼 Graphviz 會選擇性的挑 node 跟 edge 來稱呼
** The vertices belonging to an edge are called the ends, endpoints, or end vertices of the edge. A vertex may exist in a graph and not belong to an edge. 這裡 "endpoint" 在 Graphviz 的文件裡曾經看過
