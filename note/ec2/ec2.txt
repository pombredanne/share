** Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
** Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use.

** a central part of Amazon.com's cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).
** EC2 allows scalable deployment of applications by providing a Web service through which a user can boot an Amazon Machine Image to create a virtual machine, which Amazon calls an "instance", containing any software desired. 可以自訂環境再做成 image??
** A user can create, launch, and terminate server instances as needed, paying by the hour for active servers, hence the term "elastic".
** EC2 provides users with control over the geographical location of instances that allows for latency optimization and high levels of redundancy. 這是 AWS 跟 GAE 很大的不同。
** EC2 uses Xen virtualization. Each virtual machine, called an "instance".
** Reserved instances enable EC2 or RDS service users to reserve an instance for one or three years. There is a fee associated with reserving an instance. The corresponding per hour rate charged by Amazon to operate the instance is much less than the rate charged for on-demand instances.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** Amazon EC2 instances are grouped into eight families: Standard (first and second generation), Micro, High-Memory, High-CPU, Cluster Compute, Cluster GPU, and High I/O.
** First generation (M1) Standard instances provide customers with a balanced set of resources and a low cost platform that is well suited for a wide variety of applications - 1.7 GiB memory, 1 EC2 Compute Unit (1 virtual core with 1 EC2 Compute Unit) 160 GB instance storage
** Micro instances (t1.micro) provide a small amount of consistent CPU resources and allow you to increase CPU capacity in short bursts when additional cycles are available. They are well suited for lower throughput applications and web sites that require additional compute cycles periodically. 613 MiB memory, Up to 2 EC2 Compute Units (for short periodic bursts) 為什麼是 613 MiB 這個數字？強調 burst 的用意是？
** If your application has compute-intensive or steady state needs we recommend using a Small instance (or larger, depending on your needs). However, Micro instances can provide periodic bursts of additional CPU capability. Therefore, if you have a relatively low throughput application or web site with an occasional need to consume significant compute cycles, we recommend using Micro instances.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** On-Demand Instances allow you to pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitment; with Reserved Instances you pay a low, one-time fee and in turn receive a significant discount on the hourly charge for that instance.
** Spot Instances enable you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times??
** On-Demand Instances let you pay for compute capacity by the hour with no long-term commitments or upfront payments. You can increase or decrease your compute capacity depending on the demands of your application and only pay the specified hourly rate for the instances you use.
** Reserved Instances let you make a low, one-time, upfront payment for an instance, reserve it for a one or three year term, and pay a significantly lower hourly rate for that instance. 
** Reserved Instances can provide savings of up to 71% compared to using On-Demand Instances. Functionally, Reserved Instances and On-Demand Instances perform identically.
