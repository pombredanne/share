= Android Intent =

Intent 就是 "intent to do something"，做為 runtime binding 可以在不同 app component 之間傳遞資訊。有指定 app component 的是 explicit intent，否則就是 implicit intent。

 * broadcast/activity intents
 * action string 的 namespace 是 global 的。
 * intent filter & intent resolution -> potential targets
 * intent messaging, late run-time binding, between components
 * passive data structure, abstract description - operation to be performed, something that has happened（兩者的常數都是 `ACTION_` 開頭）

`PendingIntent` 跟權限有關？
________________________________________________________________________________
The returned object can be handed to other applications so that they can perform the action you described on your behalf at a later time.

By giving a PendingIntent to another application, you are granting it the right to perform the operation you have specified as if the other application was yourself (with the same permissions and identity). As such, you should be careful about how you build the PendingIntent: often, for example, the base Intent you supply will have the component name explicitly set to one of your own components, to ensure it is ultimately sent there and nowhere else.
