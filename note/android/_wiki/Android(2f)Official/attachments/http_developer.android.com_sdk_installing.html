    1. Installing ADT
    2. Adding SDK Components

   This page describes how to install the latest version of the Android
   SDK and set up your development environment for the first time.

   If you encounter any problems during installation, see the
   Troubleshooting section at the bottom of this page.

Updating?

   If you are currently using the Android 1.6 SDK, you do not necessarily
   need to install a newer SDK, since you can already update the
   platforms, tools, and other components using the Android SDK and AVD
   Manager tool. To develop against the latest Android platform, for
   example, you could just download the latest SDK Tools and then add the
   new Android platform into your existing SDK.

   If you are using Android 1.5 SDK or older, you should install the new
   SDK as described in this document and move your application projects to
   the new SDK environment.

Prepare for Installation

   Before you begin, take a moment to confirm that your development
   machine meets the System Requirements.

   If you will be developing in Eclipse with the Android Development Tools
   (ADT) Plugin — the recommended path if you are new to Android — make
   sure that you have a suitable version of Eclipse installed on your
   computer (3.4 or newer is recommended). If you need to install Eclipse,
   you can download it from this location:

   http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

   A Java or RCP version of Eclipse is recommended. For Eclipse 3.5, the
   "Eclipse Classic" version is recommended.

Download and Install the SDK

   Download the SDK package that is appropriate for your development
   computer. You can get the latest version from the SDK download page.

   After downloading, unpack the Android SDK archive to a suitable
   location on your machine. By default, the SDK files are unpacked into a
   directory named android-sdk-<machine-platform>. Make a note of the name
   and location of the unpacked SDK directory on your system — you will
   need to refer to the SDK directory later, when setting up the ADT
   plugin or when using the SDK tools.

   Optionally, you may want to add the location of the SDK's primary tools
   directory to your system PATH. The primary tools/ directory is located
   at the root of the SDK folder. Adding tools to your path lets you run
   Android Debug Bridge (adb) and the other command line tools without
   needing to supply the full path to the tools directory.
     * On Linux, edit your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc file. Look for a
       line that sets the PATH environment variable and add the full path
       to the tools/ directory to it. If you don't see a line setting the
       path, you can add one:

   export PATH=${PATH}:<your_sdk_dir>/tools

     On a Mac OS X, look in your home directory for .bash_profile and
   proceed as for Linux. You can create the .bash_profile if you haven't
   already set one up on your machine.

     On Windows, right-click on My Computer, and select Properties. Under
   the Advanced tab, hit the Environment Variables button, and in the
   dialog that comes up, double-click on Path (under System Variables).
   Add the full path to the tools/ directory to the path.

   If you will be using the Eclipse IDE as your development environment,
   the next section describes how to install the Android Development Tools
   (ADT) plugin and set up Eclipse. If you choose not to use Eclipse, you
   can develop Android applications in an IDE of your choice and then
   compile, debug and deploy using the tools included in the SDK (skip to
   Next Steps).

Install the ADT Plugin for Eclipse

   Android offers a custom plugin for the Eclipse IDE, called Android
   Development Tools (ADT), that is designed to give you a powerful,
   integrated environment in which to build Android applications. It
   extends the capabilites of Eclipse to let you quickly set up new
   Android projects, create an application UI, add components based on the
   Android Framework API, debug your applications using the Android SDK
   tools, and even export signed (or unsigned) APKs in order to distribute
   your application.

   In general, using Eclipse with ADT is a highly recommended approach to
   Android development and is the fastest way to get started. For complete
   information about how to install ADT, see Installing and Updating ADT.

   If you prefer to work in an IDE other than Eclipse, you do not need to
   install Eclipse or ADT, instead, you can directly use the SDK tools to
   build and debug your application.

Add Android Platforms and Other Components

   The Android SDK and AVD Manager tool is pre-installed in your SDK.
   Using the tool is a key part of performing the initial setup of your
   SDK, as well as keeping it up-to-date with the latest platforms, tools,
   and other components.

   For full instructions on how to use the tool, see Adding SDK
   Components.

   The Android SDK uses a modular structure that separates the major parts
   of the SDK — platforms, add-ons, tools, and the API documentation —
   into a set of separately installable components. The SDK components are
   available to you for individual download, as needed, from the Android
   SDK repository site.

   The Android SDK starter package includes only a single component: the
   latest version of the SDK Tools. Included in that component is a tool
   called Android SDK and AVD Manager that you can use to download other
   components from the SDK repository site. The tool provides a graphical
   UI that lets you browse the repository, select new or updated
   components for download, and then install them in your SDK.

   There are several types of SDK components available:
     * SDK Tools (available pre-installed in the Android SDK package) —
       Contains the full set of SDK tools for developing, debugging, and
       testing your application code and UI. You can read about the tools
       in the Dev Guide and access them in the <sdk>/tools/ directory.
     * Android platforms — An SDK platform component is available for
       every production Android platform deployable to Android-powered
       devices. Each platform component includes a fully compliant Android
       library and system image, sample code, emulator skins, and any
       version specific tools. For detailed information about each
       platform, see the overview documents available under the section
       "Downloadable SDK Components," at left.
     * SDK Add-Ons — SDK add-ons provide a development environment for
       specific Android external library or a customized (but fully
       compliant) Android system image. The Android SDK repository offers
       the Google APIs Add-On, which gives your application access to
       powerful mapping capabilities through the com.google.android.maps
       library. You can also add additional repositories, so that you can
       download other SDK add-ons, where available.
     * Documentation — Contains a local copy of the latest multiversion
       documentation for the Android framework API.

   To develop any Android application, even if you are following the Hello
   World tutorial, you must download at least one Android platform into
   your SDK. Typically, you will want to download multiple platforms, so
   that you can build your application on the lowest version you want to
   support, but test against higher versions that you intend the
   application to run on. You can test your applications on different
   platforms by running in an Android Virtual Device (AVD) on the Android
   emulator.

   For step-by-step instructions on how to use the Android SDK and AVD
   Manager to add components, see the Adding SDK Components document.

   For release notes and other detailed information about individual SDK
   components, see the documents listed under "Downloadable SDK
   Components" in the navigation at left.

Explore the SDK

   Once you've installed the SDK and downloaded the platforms,
   documentation, and add-ons that you need, open the SDK directory and
   take a look at what's inside.

   The table below describes the full SDK directory contents, with
   components installed.

   Android SDK and AVD Manager tool, which you use to add components to
   your SDK.

Next Steps

   Once you have completed installation, you are ready to begin developing
   applications. Here are a few ways you can get started:

   Learn about Android
     * Take a look at the Dev Guide and the types of information it
       provides
     * Read an introduction to Android as a platform in What is Android?
     * Learn about the Android framework and how applications run on it in
       Application Fundamentals
     * Take a look at the Android framework API specification in the
       Reference tab

   Explore the SDK
     * Get an overview of the development tools that are available to you
     * Read how to develop in Eclipse/ADT or in other IDEs

   Explore some code
     * Set up a Hello World application (highly recommended, especially
       for Eclipse users)
     * Follow the Notepad Tutorial to build a full Android application
     * Create a new project for one of the other sample applications
       included in <sdk>/platforms/<platform>/samples, then compile and
       run it in your development environment

   Visit the Android developer groups
     * Take a look at the Community pages to see a list of Android
       developers groups. In particular, you might want to look at the
       Android Developers group to get a sense for what the Android
       developer community is like.

Troubleshooting

Ubuntu Linux Notes

     * If you need help installing and configuring Java on your
       development machine, you might find these resources helpful:
          + https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java
          + https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JavaInstallation
     * Here are the steps to install Java and Eclipse, prior to installing
       the Android SDK and ADT Plugin.
         1. If you are running a 64-bit distribution on your development
            machine, you need to install the ia32-libs package using
            apt-get::
apt-get install ia32-libs
         2. Next, install Java:
apt-get install sun-java6-bin
         3. The Ubuntu package manager does not currently offer an Eclipse
            3.3 version for download, so we recommend that you download
            Eclipse from eclipse.org (http://www.eclipse.org/ downloads/).
            A Java or RCP version of Eclipse is recommended.
         4. Follow the steps given in previous sections to install the SDK
            and the ADT plugin.

Other Linux Notes

     * If JDK is already installed on your development computer, please
       take a moment to make sure that it meets the version requirements
       listed in the System Requirements. In particular, note that some
       Linux distributions may include JDK 1.4 or Gnu Compiler for Java,
       both of which are not supported for Android development.
