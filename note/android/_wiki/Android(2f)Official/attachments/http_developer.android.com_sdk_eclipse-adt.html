Installing and Updating ADT

In this document

    2. Installing the ADT Plugin
         1. Troubleshooting
    3. Updating the ADT Plugin
    4. Uninstalling the ADT Plugin

   Android offers a custom plugin for the Eclipse IDE, called Android
   Development Tools (ADT), that is designed to give you a powerful,
   integrated environment in which to build Android applications.

   ADT extends the capabilites of Eclipse to let you quickly set up new
   Android projects, create an application UI, add components based on the
   Android Framework API, debug your applications using the Android SDK
   tools, and even export signed (or unsigned) APKs in order to distribute
   your application.

   In general, using Eclipse with ADT is a highly recommended approach to
   Android development and is the fastest way to get started. If you use
   Eclipse, the ADT plugin gives you an incredible boost in developing
   Android applications.

   To install and update the ADT Plugin, you can take advantage of the
   Eclipse remote update feature. By setting up a remote update site, you
   can easily download, install, and check for ADT updates. Alternatively,
   you can download the latest ADT to your development computer as a local
   site archive. The sections below provide instructions for both methods.

Prepare for Installation

   Before you begin, take a moment to confirm that your development
   machine meets the System Requirements.

   If you will be developing in Eclipse with the Android Development Tools
   (ADT) Plugin — the recommended path if you are new to Android — make
   sure that you have a suitable version of Eclipse installed on your
   computer (3.4 or newer is recommended). If you need to install Eclipse,
   you can download it from this location:

   http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

   A Java or RCP version of Eclipse is recommended.

Installing the ADT Plugin

   Once you have the Eclipse IDE installed, as described in Preparing for
   Installation, above, follow these steps to download the ADT plugin and
   install it in your respective Eclipse environment.
   Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede) Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo)
    1. Start Eclipse, then select Help > Software Updates.... In the
       dialog that appears, click the Available Software tab.
    2. Click Add Site...
    3. In the Add Site dialog that appears, enter this URL in the
       "Location" field:
https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/
       Note: If you have trouble aqcuiring the plugin, try using "http" in
       the Location URL, instead of "https" (https is preferred for
       security reasons).
       Click OK.
    4. Back in the Available Software view, you should see the plugin
       listed by the URL, with "Developer Tools" nested within it. Select
       the checkbox next to Developer Tools and click Install...
    5. On the subsequent Install window, "Android DDMS" and "Android
       Development Tools" should both be checked. Click Next.
    6. Read and accept the license agreement, then click Finish.
    7. Restart Eclipse.

    1. Start Eclipse, then select Help > Install New Softare.
    2. In the Available Software dialog, click Add....
    3. In the Add Site dialog that appears, enter a name for the remote
       site (for example, "Android Plugin") in the "Name" field.
       In the "Location" field, enter this URL:
https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/
       Note: If you have trouble aqcuiring the plugin, you can try using
       "http" in the URL, instead of "https" (https is preferred for
       security reasons).
       Click OK.
    4. Back in the Available Software view, you should now see "Developer
       Tools" added to the list. Select the checkbox next to Developer
       Tools, which will automatically select the nested tools Android
       DDMS and Android Development Tools. Click Next.
    5. In the resulting Install Details dialog, the Android DDMS and
       Android Development Tools features are listed. Click Next to read
       and accept the license agreement and install any dependencies, then
       click Finish.
    6. Restart Eclipse.

   Now modify your Eclipse preferences to point to the Android SDK
   directory:
    1. Select Window > Preferences... to open the Preferences panel (Mac
       OS X: Eclipse > Preferences).
    2. Select Android from the left panel.
    3. For the SDK Location in the main panel, click Browse... and locate
       your downloaded SDK directory.
    4. Click Apply, then OK.

   Done! If you haven't encountered any problems, then you're ready to
   begin developing Android applications.

Troubleshooting ADT Installation

   If you are having trouble downloading the ADT plugin after following
   the steps above, here are some suggestions:
     * If Eclipse can not find the remote update site containing the ADT
       plugin, try changing the remote site URL to use http, rather than
       https. That is, set the Location for the remote site to:
http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/
     * If you are behind a firewall (such as a corporate firewall), make
       sure that you have properly configured your proxy settings in
       Eclipse. In Eclipse 3.3/3.4, you can configure proxy information
       from the main Eclipse menu in Window (on Mac OS X, Eclipse) >
       Preferences > General > Network Connections.

   If you are still unable to use Eclipse to download the ADT plugin as a
   remote update site, you can download the ADT zip file to your local
   machine and manually install it:
    1. Download the current ADT Plugin zip file from the table below (do
       not unpack it).

         Name       Package        Size                MD5 Checksum
       ADT 0.9.5 ADT-0.9.5.zip 3372982 bytes 227ec538359fbe417ccde7f0ad614a96
    2. Follow steps 1 and 2 in the default install instructions (above).
    3. In the Add Site dialog, click Archive.
    4. Browse and select the downloaded zip file.
    5. In Eclipse 3.5 only, enter a name for the local update site (e.g.,
       "Android Plugin") in the "Name" field.
    6. Click OK.
    7. Follow the remaining procedures as listed for default installation
       above, starting from step 4.

   To update your plugin once you've installed using the zip file, you
   will have to follow these steps again instead of the default update
   instructions.

Other install errors

   Note that there are features of ADT that require some optional Eclipse
   components (for example, WST). If you encounter an error when
   installing ADT, your Eclipse installion might not include these
   components. For information about how to quickly add the necessary
   components to your Eclipse installation, see the troubleshooting topic
   ADT Installation Error: "requires plug-in org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui".

For Linux users

   If you encounter this error when installing the ADT Plugin for Eclipse:
An error occurred during provisioning.
Cannot connect to keystore.
JKS

   ...then your development machine lacks a suitable Java VM. Installing
   Sun Java 6 will resolve this issue and you can then reinstall the ADT
   Plugin.

Updating Your Eclipse ADT Plugin

   From time to time, a new version of the ADT Plugin becomes available.
   Follow the steps below to check whether an update is available and, if
   so, to install it. For information about new features in ADT, see the
   ADT Plugin Notes document.
