Notepad Tutorial

   This tutorial on writing a notepad application gives you a "hands-on"
   introduction to the Android framework and the tools you use to build
   applications on it. Starting from a preconfigured project file, it
   guides you through the process of developing a simple notepad
   application and provides concrete examples of how to set up the
   project, develop the application logic and user interface, and then
   compile and run the application.

   The tutorial presents the application development as a set of exercises
   (see below), each consisting of several steps. You should follow the
   steps in each exercise to gradually build and refine your application.
   The exercises explain each step in detail and provide all the sample
   code you need to complete the application.

   When you are finished with the tutorial, you will have created a
   functioning Android application and will have learned many of the most
   important concepts in Android development. If you want to add more
   complex features to your application, you can examine the code in an
   alternative implementation of a Note Pad application, in the Sample
   Code section.

Who Should Use this Tutorial

   This tutorial is designed for experienced developers, especially those
   with knowledge of the Java programming language. If you haven't written
   Java applications before, you can still use the tutorial, but you might
   need to work at a slower pace.

   Also note that this tutorial uses the Eclipse development environment,
   with the Android plugin installed. If you are not using Eclipse, you
   can follow the exercises and build the application, but you will need
   to determine how to accomplish the Eclipse-specific steps in your
   environment.

Preparing for the Exercises

   The tutorial assumes that you have some familiarity with basic Android
   application concepts and terminology. If you are not, you should read
   Application Fundamentals before continuing.

   This tutorial also builds on the introductory information provided in
   the Hello World tutorial, which explains how to set up your Eclipse
   environment for building Android applications. We recommend you
   complete the Hello World tutorial before starting this one.

   To prepare for this lesson:
    1. Download the project exercises archive (.zip).
    2. Unpack the archive file to a suitable location on your machine.
    3. Open the NotepadCodeLab folder.

   Inside the NotepadCodeLab folder, you should see six project files:
   Notepadv1, Notepadv2, Notepadv3, Notepadv1Solution, Notepadv2Solution
   and Notepadv3Solution. The Notepadv# projects are the starting points
   for each of the exercises, while the Notepadv#Solution projects are the
   exercise solutions. If you are having trouble with a particular
   exercise, you can compare your current work against the exercise
   solution.

Exercises

   The table below lists the tutorial exercises and describes the
   development areas that each covers. Each exercise assumes that you have
   completed any previous exercises.
   Exercise 1 Start here. Construct a simple notes list that lets the user
   add new notes but not edit them. Demonstrates the basics of
   ListActivity and creating and handling menu options. Uses a SQLite
   database to store the notes.
   Exercise 2 Add a second Activity to the application. Demonstrates
   constructing a new Activity, adding it to the Android manifest, passing
   data between the activities, and using more advanced screen layout.
   Also shows how to invoke another Activity to return a result, using
   startActivityForResult().
   Exercise 3 Add handling of life-cycle events to the application, to let
   it maintain application state across the life cycle.
   Extra Credit Demonstrates how to use the Eclipse debugger and how you
   can use it to view life-cycle events as they are generated. This
   section is optional but highly recommended.

Other Resources and Further Learning

     * For a lighter but broader introduction to concepts not covered in
       the tutorial, take a look at Common Android Tasks.
     * The Android SDK includes a variety of fully functioning sample
       applications that make excellent opportunities for further
       learning. You can find the sample applications in the samples/
       directory of your downloaded SDK, or browser them here, in the
       Sample Code section.
     * This tutorial draws from the full Notepad application included in
       the samples/ directory of the SDK, though it does not match it
       exactly. When you are done with the tutorial, it is highly
       recommended that you take a closer look at this version of the
       Notepad application, as it demonstrates a variety of interesting
       additions for your application, such as:

     * Setting up a custom striped list for the list of notes.
     * Creating a custom text edit view that overrides the draw() method
       to make it look like a lined notepad.
     * Implementing a full ContentProvider for notes.
     * Reverting and discarding edits instead of just automatically saving
       them.
