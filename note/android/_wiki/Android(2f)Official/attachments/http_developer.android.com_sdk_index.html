Download the Android SDK

   December 2009

   The Android SDK has changed! If you've worked with the Android SDK
   before, you will notice several important differences:
     * The SDK downloadable package includes only the latest version of
       the Android SDK Tools.
     * Once you've installed the SDK, you now use the Android SDK and AVD
       Manager to download all of the SDK components that you need, such
       as Android platforms, SDK add-ons, tools, and documentation.
     * The new approach is modular — you can install only the components
       you need and update any or all components without affecting other
       parts of your development environment.
     * In short, once you've installed the new SDK, you will not need to
       download an SDK package again. Instead, you will use the Android
       SDK and AVD Manager to keep your development environment
       up-to-date.

   If you are currently using the Android 1.6 SDK, you do not need to
   install the new SDK, because your existing SDK already includes the
   Android SDK and AVD Manager tool. To develop against Android 2.0.1, for
   example, you can just download the Android 2.0.1 platform (and updated
   SDK Tools) into your existing SDK. Refer to Adding SDK Components.

   If you are new to the Android SDK, please read the Quick Start, below,
   for an overview of how to install and set up the SDK.

Quick Start

   The steps below provide an overview of how to get started with the
   Android SDK. For detailed instructions, start with the Installing
   guide.

   0. Prepare your development computer

   Read the System Requirements document and make sure that your
   development computer meets the hardware and software requirements for
   the Android SDK. Install any additional software needed before
   downloading the Android SDK. In particular, if you plan to develop
   Android applications in the Eclipse IDE using the ADT Plugin (see
   below), make sure that you have the correct version of Eclipse
   installed.

   1. Download and install the SDK starter package

   Select a starter package from the table at the top of this page and
   download it to your development computer. To install the SDK, simply
   unpack the starter package to a safe location and then add the location
   to your PATH.

   2. Install the ADT Plugin for Eclipse

   If you are developing in Eclipse, set up a remote update site and
   install the Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin. For detailed
   instructions, see Installing and Updating ADT.

   3. Add Android platforms to your SDK

   Use the Android SDK and AVD Manager, included in the SDK starter
   package, to add one or more Android platforms (for example, Android 1.6
   or Android 2.0) to your SDK. In most cases, you will want to download
   multiple platforms, so that you can build your application on the
   lowest version you want to support, but test against higher versions
   that you intend the application to run on. Information about each
   platform is available at left, under "Downloadable SDK Components."

   To launch the Android SDK and AVD Manager on Windows, execute SDK
   Setup.exe, at the root of the SDK directory. On Mac OS X or Linux,
   execute the android tool in the <sdk>/tools/ folder. For more
   information about how to add platforms and other components, see Adding
   SDK Components.

   4. Get the latest documentation

   If you develop while offline, use the Android SDK and AVD Manager to
   download the latest documentation package. The documentation covers all
   versions of the API and lets you filter out those versions that your
   application won't support. Once installed, the documentation is also
   available to you directly from the Eclipse IDE. When you are online,
   you can always access the latest documentation at the Android
   Developers site.

   5. Download other SDK components

   You can use the Android SDK and AVD Manager to download other SDK
   components, such as the SDK add-ons. An SDK add-on provides a
   development environment for an Android external library or a customized
   Android system image. For example, the Google APIs Add-On lets you
   develop an application that takes advantage of the Google Maps external
   library.

   6. Get started with an application project

   Once you've set up your SDK, the next step is to start a new
   application project or move existing applications into the new SDK.

   If you are new to Android, you can use the Hello World tutorial to get
   started quickly. Next Steps offers other suggestions of how to begin.
