Notepad Exercise 1

   In this exercise, you will construct a simple notes list that lets the
   user add new notes but not edit them. The exercise demonstrates:
     * The basics of ListActivities and creating and handling menu
       options.
     * How to use a SQLite database to store the notes.
     * How to bind data from a database cursor into a ListView using a
       SimpleCursorAdapter.
     * The basics of screen layouts, including how to lay out a list view,
       how you can add items to the activity menu, and how the activity
       handles those menu selections.

   [Exercise 1] [Exercise 2] [Exercise 3] [Extra Credit]

Step 1

   Open up the Notepadv1 project in Eclipse.

   Notepadv1 is a project that is provided as a starting point. It takes
   care of some of the boilerplate work that you have already seen if you
   followed the Hello, World tutorial.
    1. Start a new Android Project by clicking File > New > Android
       Project.
    2. In the New Android Project dialog, select Create project from
       existing source.
    3. Click Browse and navigate to where you copied the NotepadCodeLab
       (downloaded during setup) and select Notepadv1.
    4. The Project Name and other properties should be automatically
       filled for you. You must select the Build Target—we recommend
       selecting a target with the lowest platform version available. Also
       add an integer to the Min SDK Version field that matches the API
       Level of the selected Build Target.
    5. Click Finish. The Notepadv1 project should open and be visible in
       your Eclipse package explorer.

   If you see an error about AndroidManifest.xml, or some problems related
   to an Android zip file, right click on the project and select Android
   Tools > Fix Project Properties. (The project is looking in the wrong
   location for the library file, this will fix it for you.)

Step 2

Accessing and modifying data

   For this exercise, we are using a SQLite database to store our data.
   This is useful if only your application will need to access or modify
   the data. If you wish for other activities to access or modify the
   data, you have to expose the data using a ContentProvider.

   If you are interested, you can find out more about content providers or
   the whole subject of Data Storage. The NotePad sample in the samples/
   folder of the SDK also has an example of how to create a
   ContentProvider.

   Take a look at the NotesDbAdapter class — this class is provided to
   encapsulate data access to a SQLite database that will hold our notes
   data and allow us to update it.

   At the top of the class are some constant definitions that will be used
   in the application to look up data from the proper field names in the
   database. There is also a database creation string defined, which is
   used to create a new database schema if one doesn't exist already.

   Our database will have the name data, and have a single table called
   notes, which in turn has three fields: _id, title and body. The _id is
   named with an underscore convention used in a number of places inside
   the Android SDK and helps keep a track of state. The _id usually has to
   be specified when querying or updating the database (in the column
   projections and so on). The other two fields are simple text fields
   that will store data.

   The constructor for NotesDbAdapter takes a Context, which allows it to
   communicate with aspects of the Android operating system. This is quite
   common for classes that need to touch the Android system in some way.
   The Activity class implements the Context class, so usually you will
   just pass this from your Activity, when needing a Context.

   The open() method calls up an instance of DatabaseHelper, which is our
   local implementation of the SQLiteOpenHelper class. It calls
   getWritableDatabase(), which handles creating/opening a database for
   us.

   close() just closes the database, releasing resources related to the
   connection.

   createNote() takes strings for the title and body of a new note, then
   creates that note in the database. Assuming the new note is created
   successfully, the method also returns the row _id value for the newly
   created note.

   deleteNote() takes a rowId for a particular note, and deletes that note
   from the database.

   fetchAllNotes() issues a query to return a Cursor over all notes in the
   database. The query() call is worth examination and understanding. The
   first field is the name of the database table to query (in this case
   DATABASE_TABLE is "notes"). The next is the list of columns we want
   returned, in this case we want the _id, title and body columns so these
   are specified in the String array. The remaining fields are, in order:
   selection, selectionArgs, groupBy, having and orderBy. Having these all
   null means we want all data, need no grouping, and will take the
   default order. See SQLiteDatabase for more details.

   Note: A Cursor is returned rather than a collection of rows. This
   allows Android to use resources efficiently -- instead of putting lots
   of data straight into memory the cursor will retrieve and release data
   as it is needed, which is much more efficient for tables with lots of
   rows.

   fetchNote() is similar to fetchAllNotes() but just gets one note with
   the rowId we specify. It uses a slightly different version of the
   SQLiteDatabase query() method. The first parameter (set true) indicates
   that we are interested in one distinct result. The selection parameter
   (the fourth parameter) has been specified to search only for the row
   "where _id =" the rowId we passed in. So we are returned a Cursor on
   the one row.

   And finally, updateNote() takes a rowId, title and body, and uses a
   ContentValues instance to update the note of the given rowId.

Step 3

Layouts and activities

   Most Activity classes will have a layout associated with them. The
   layout will be the "face" of the Activity to the user. In this case our
   layout will take over the whole screen and provide a list of notes.

   Full screen layouts are not the only option for an Activity however.
   You might also want to use a floating layout (for example, a dialog or
   alert), or perhaps you don't need a layout at all (the Activity will be
   invisible to the user unless you specify some kind of layout for it to
   use).

   Open the notepad_list.xml file in res/layout and take a look at it.
   (You may have to hit the xml tab, at the bottom, in order to view the
   XML markup.)

   This is a mostly-empty layout definition file. Here are some things you
   should know about a layout file:
     * All Android layout files must start with the XML header line: <?xml
       version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>.
     * The next definition will often (but not always) be a layout
       definition of some kind, in this case a LinearLayout.
     * The XML namespace of Android should always be defined in the top
       level component or layout in the XML so that android: tags can be
       used through the rest of the file:
       xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"

Step 4

   We need to create the layout to hold our list. Add code inside of the
   LinearLayout element so the whole file looks like this:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content">

  <ListView android:id="@android:id/list"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>
  <TextView android:id="@android:id/empty"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="@string/no_notes"/>

</LinearLayout>

     * The @ symbol in the id strings of the ListView and TextView tags
       means that the XML parser should parse and expand the rest of the
       id string and use an ID resource.
     * The ListView and TextView can be thought as two alternative views,
       only one of which will be displayed at once. ListView will be used
       when there are notes to be shown, while the TextView (which has a
       default value of "No Notes Yet!" defined as a string resource in
       res/values/strings.xml) will be displayed if there aren't any notes
       to display.
     * The list and empty IDs are provided for us by the Android platform,
       so, we must prefix the id with android: (e.g., @android:id/list).
     * The View with the empty id is used automatically when the
       ListAdapter has no data for the ListView. The ListAdapter knows to
       look for this name by default. Alternatively, you could change the
       default empty view by using setEmptyView(View) on the ListView.
       More broadly, the android.R class is a set of predefined resources
       provided for you by the platform, while your project's R class is
       the set of resources your project has defined. Resources found in
       the android.R resource class can be used in the XML files by using
       the android: name space prefix (as we see here).

Step 5

Resources and the R class

   The folders under res/ in the Eclipse project are for resources. There
   is a specific structure to the folders and files under res/.

   Resources defined in these folders and files will have corresponding
   entries in the R class allowing them to be easily accessed and used
   from your application. The R class is automatically generated using the
   contents of the res/ folder by the eclipse plugin (or by aapt if you
   use the command line tools). Furthermore, they will be bundled and
   deployed for you as part of the application.

   To make the list of notes in the ListView, we also need to define a
   View for each row:
    1. Create a new file under res/layout called notes_row.xml.
    2. Add the following contents (note: again the XML header is used, and
       the first node defines the Android XML namespace)
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<TextView android:id="@+id/text1"
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>
       This is the View that will be used for each notes title row — it
       has only one text field in it.
       In this case we create a new id called text1. The + after the @ in
       the id string indicates that the id should be automatically created
       as a resource if it does not already exist, so we are defining
       text1 on the fly and then using it.
    3. Save the file.

   Open the R.java class in the project and look at it, you should see new
   definitions for notes_row and text1 (our new definitions) meaning we
   can now gain access to these from the our code.

Step 6

   Next, open the Notepadv1 class in the source. In the following steps,
   we are going to alter this class to become a list adapter and display
   our notes, and also allow us to add new notes.

   Notepadv1 will inherit from a subclass of Activity called a
   ListActivity, which has extra functionality to accommodate the kinds of
   things you might want to do with a list, for example: displaying an
   arbitrary number of list items in rows on the screen, moving through
   the list items, and allowing them to be selected.

   Take a look through the existing code in Notepadv1 class. There is a
   currently an unused private field called mNoteNumber that we will use
   to create numbered note titles.

   There are also three override methods defined: onCreate,
   onCreateOptionsMenu and onOptionsItemSelected; we need to fill these
   out:
     * onCreate() is called when the activity is started — it is a little
       like the "main" method for an Activity. We use this to set up
       resources and state for the activity when it is running.
     * onCreateOptionsMenu() is used to populate the menu for the
       Activity. This is shown when the user hits the menu button, and has
       a list of options they can select (like "Create Note").
     * onOptionsItemSelected() is the other half of the menu equation, it
       is used to handle events generated from the menu (e.g., when the
       user selects the "Create Note" item).

Step 7

   Change the inheritance of Notepadv1 from Activity to ListActivity:
public class Notepadv1 extends ListActivity

   Note: you will have to import ListActivity into the Notepadv1 class
   using Eclipse, ctrl-shift-O on Windows or Linux, or cmd-shift-O on the
   Mac (organize imports) will do this for you after you've written the
   above change.

Step 8

   Fill out the body of the onCreate() method.

   Here we will set the title for the Activity (shown at the top of the
   screen), use the notepad_list layout we created in XML, set up the
   NotesDbAdapter instance that will access notes data, and populate the
   list with the available note titles:
    1. In the onCreate method, call super.onCreate() with the
       savedInstanceState parameter that's passed in.
    2. Call setContentView() and pass R.layout.notepad_list.
    3. At the top of the class, create a new private class field called
       mDbHelper of class NotesDbAdapter.
    4. Back in the onCreate method, construct a new NotesDbAdapter
       instance and assign it to the mDbHelper field (pass this into the
       constructor for DBHelper)
    5. Call the open() method on mDbHelper to open (or create) the
       database.
    6. Finally, call a new method fillData(), which will get the data and
       populate the ListView using the helper — we haven't defined this
       method yet.

   onCreate() should now look like this:
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.notepad_list);
        mDbHelper = new NotesDbAdapter(this);
        mDbHelper.open();
        fillData();
    }

   And be sure you have the mDbHelper field definition (right under the
   mNoteNumber definition):
    private NotesDbAdapter mDbHelper;

Step 9

More on menus

   The notepad application we are constructing only scratches the surface
   with menus.

   You can also add shortcut keys for menu items, create submenus and even
   add menu items to other applications!.

   Fill out the body of the onCreateOptionsMenu() method.

   We will now create the "Add Item" button that can be accessed by
   pressing the menu button on the device. We'll specify that it occupy
   the first position in the menu.
    1. In strings.xml resource (under res/values), add a new string named
       "menu_insert" with its value set to Add Item:
<string name="menu_insert">Add Item</string>
       Then save the file and return to Notepadv1.
    2. Create a menu position constant at the top of the class:
public static final int INSERT_ID = Menu.FIRST;
    3. In the onCreateOptionsMenu() method, change the super call so we
       capture the boolean return as result. We'll return this value at
       the end.
    4. Then add the menu item with menu.add().

   The whole method should now look like this:
    @Override
    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        boolean result = super.onCreateOptionsMenu(menu);
        menu.add(0, INSERT_ID, 0, R.string.menu_insert);
        return result;
    }

   The arguments passed to add() indicate: a group identifier for this
   menu (none, in this case), a unique ID (defined above), the order of
   the item (zero indicates no preference), and the resource of the string
   to use for the item.

Step 10

   Fill out the body of the onOptionsItemSelected() method:

   This is going to handle our new "Add Note" menu item. When this is
   selected, the onOptionsItemSelected() method will be called with the
   item.getId() set to INSERT_ID (the constant we used to identify the
   menu item). We can detect this, and take the appropriate actions:
    1. The super.onOptionsItemSelected(item) method call goes at the end
       of this method — we want to catch our events first!
    2. Write a switch statement on item.getItemId().
       In the case of INSERT_ID, call a new method, createNote(), and
       return true, because we have handled this event and do not want to
       propagate it through the system.
    3. Return the result of the superclass' onOptionsItemSelected() method
       at the end.

   The whole onOptionsItemSelect() method should now look like this:
    @Override
    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
        switch (item.getItemId()) {
        case INSERT_ID:
            createNote();
            return true;
        }

        return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
    }

Step 11

   Add a new createNote() method:

   In this first version of our application, createNote() is not going to
   be very useful. We will simply create a new note with a title assigned
   to it based on a counter ("Note 1", "Note 2"...) and with an empty
   body. At present we have no way of editing the contents of a note, so
   for now we will have to be content making one with some default values:
    1. Construct the name using "Note" and the counter we defined in the
       class: String noteName = "Note " + mNoteNumber++
    2. Call mDbHelper.createNote() using noteName as the title and "" for
       the body
    3. Call fillData() to populate the list of notes (inefficient but
       simple) — we'll create this method next.

   The whole createNote() method should look like this:
    private void createNote() {
        String noteName = "Note " + mNoteNumber++;
        mDbHelper.createNote(noteName, "");
        fillData();
    }

Step 12

List adapters

   Our example uses a SimpleCursorAdapter to bind a database Cursor into a
   ListView, and this is a common way to use a ListAdapter. Other options
   exist like ArrayAdapter which can be used to take a List or Array of
   in-memory data and bind it in to a list as well.

   Define the fillData() method:

   This method uses SimpleCursorAdapter, which takes a database Cursor and
   binds it to fields provided in the layout. These fields define the row
   elements of our list (in this case we use the text1 field in our
   notes_row.xml layout), so this allows us to easily populate the list
   with entries from our database.

   To do this we have to provide a mapping from the title field in the
   returned Cursor, to our text1 TextView, which is done by defining two
   arrays: the first a string array with the list of columns to map from
   (just "title" in this case, from the constant NotesDbAdapter.KEY_TITLE)
   and, the second, an int array containing references to the views that
   we'll bind the data into (the R.id.text1 TextView).

   This is a bigger chunk of code, so let's first take a look at it:
    private void fillData() {
        // Get all of the notes from the database and create the item list
        Cursor c = mDbHelper.fetchAllNotes();
        startManagingCursor(c);

        String[] from = new String[] { NotesDbAdapter.KEY_TITLE };
        int[] to = new int[] { R.id.text1 };

        // Now create an array adapter and set it to display using our row
        SimpleCursorAdapter notes =
            new SimpleCursorAdapter(this, R.layout.notes_row, c, from, to);
        setListAdapter(notes);
    }

   Here's what we've done:
    1. After obtaining the Cursor from mDbHelper.fetchAllNotes(), we use
       an Activity method called startManagingCursor() that allows Android
       to take care of the Cursor lifecycle instead of us needing to worry
       about it. (We will cover the implications of the lifecycle in
       exercise 3, but for now just know that this allows Android to do
       some of our resource management work for us.)
    2. Then we create a string array in which we declare the column(s) we
       want (just the title, in this case), and an int array that defines
       the View(s) to which we'd like to bind the columns (these should be
       in order, respective to the string array, but here we only have one
       for each).
    3. Next is the SimpleCursorAdapter instantiation. Like many classes in
       Android, the SimpleCursorAdapter needs a Context in order to do its
       work, so we pass in this for the context (since subclasses of
       Activity implement Context). We pass the notes_row View we created
       as the receptacle for the data, the Cursor we just created, and
       then our arrays.

   In the future, remember that the mapping between the from columns and
   to resources is done using the respective ordering of the two arrays.
   If we had more columns we wanted to bind, and more Views to bind them
   in to, we would specify them in order, for example we might use {
   NotesDbAdapter.KEY_TITLE, NotesDbAdapter.KEY_BODY } and { R.id.text1,
   R.id.text2 } to bind two fields into the row (and we would also need to
   define text2 in the notes_row.xml, for the body text). This is how you
   can bind multiple fields into a single row (and get a custom row layout
   as well).

   If you get compiler errors about classes not being found, ctrl-shift-O
   or (cmd-shift-O on the mac) to organize imports.

Step 13

   Run it!
    1. Right click on the Notepadv1 project.
    2. From the popup menu, select Run As > Android Application.
    3. If you see a dialog come up, select Android Launcher as the way of
       running the application (you can also use the link near the top of
       the dialog to set this as your default for the workspace; this is
       recommended as it will stop the plugin from asking you this every
       time).
    4. Add new notes by hitting the menu button and selecting Add Item
       from the menu.
