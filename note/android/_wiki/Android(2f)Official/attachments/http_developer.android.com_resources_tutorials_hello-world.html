Hello, World

In this document

    1. Create an AVD
    2. Create the Project
    3. Construct the UI
    4. Run the Code
    5. Upgrade the UI to an XML Layout
    6. Debug Your Project
    7. Creating the Project Without Eclipse

   As a developer, you know that the first impression of a development
   framework is how easy it is to write "Hello, World." Well, on Android,
   it's pretty easy. It's particularly easy if you're using Eclipse as
   your IDE, because we've provided a great plugin that handles your
   project creation and management to greatly speed-up your development
   cycles.

   If you're not using Eclipse, that's okay. Familiarize yourself with
   Developing in Other IDEs. You can then return to this tutorial and
   ignore anything about Eclipse.

   Before you start, you should already have the very latest SDK
   installed, and if you're using Eclipse, you should have installed the
   ADT plugin as well. If you have not installed these, see Installing the
   Android SDK and return here when you've completed the installation.

Create an AVD

   To learn more about how to use AVDs and the options available to you,
   refer to the Android Virtual Devices document.

   In this tutorial, you will run your application in the Android
   Emulator. Before you can launch the emulator, you must create an
   Android Virtual Device (AVD). An AVD defines the system image and
   device settings used by the emulator.

   To create an AVD, use the "android" tool provided in the Android SDK.
   Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the tools/ directory in
   the SDK package and execute:
android create avd --target 2 --name my_avd

   The tool now asks if you would like to create a custom hardware
   profile. For the time being, press Return to skip it ("no" is the
   default response). That's it. This configures an AVD named "my_avd"
   that uses the Android 1.5 platform. The AVD is now ready for use in the
   emulator.

   In the above command, the --target option is required and specifies the
   deployment target to run on the emulator. The --name option is also
   required and defines the name for the new AVD.

Create a New Android Project

   After you've created an AVD, the next step is to start a new Android
   project in Eclipse.
    1. From Eclipse, select File > New > Project.
       If the ADT Plugin for Eclipse has been successfully installed, the
       resulting dialog should have a folder labeled "Android" which
       should contain "Android Project". (After you create one or more
       Android projects, an entry for "Android XML File" will also be
       available.)
    2. Select "Android Project" and click Next.
    3. Fill in the project details with the following values:
          + Project name: HelloAndroid
          + Application name: Hello, Android
          + Package name: com.example.helloandroid (or your own private
            namespace)
          + Create Activity: HelloAndroid
          + Min SDK Version: 2
       Click Finish.
       Here is a description of each field:

        Project Name
                This is the Eclipse Project name — the name of the
                directory that will contain the project files.

        Application Name
                This is the human-readable title for your application —
                the name that will appear on the Android device.

        Package Name
                This is the package namespace (following the same rules as
                for packages in the Java programming language) that you
                want all your source code to reside under. This also sets
                the package name under which the stub Activity will be
                generated.

                Your package name must be unique across all packages
                installed on the Android system; for this reason, it's
                very important to use a standard domain-style package for
                your applications. The example above uses the
                "com.example" namespace, which is a namespace reserved for
                example documentation — when you develop your own
                applications, you should use a namespace that's
                appropriate to your organization or entity.

        Create Activity
                This is the name for the class stub that will be generated
                by the plugin. This will be a subclass of Android's
                Activity class. An Activity is simply a class that can run
                and do work. It can create a UI if it chooses, but it
                doesn't need to. As the checkbox suggests, this is
                optional, but an Activity is almost always used as the
                basis for an application.

        Min SDK Version
                This value specifies the minimum API Level required by
                your application. If the API Level entered here matches
                the API Level provided by one of the available targets,
                then that Build Target will be automatically selected (in
                this case, entering "2" as the API Level will select the
                Android 1.1 target). With each new version of the Android
                system image and Android SDK, there have likely been
                additions or changes made to the APIs. When this occurs, a
                new API Level is assigned to the system image to regulate
                which applications are allowed to be run. If an
                application requires an API Level that is higher than the
                level supported by the device, then the application will
                not be installed.

       Other fields: The checkbox for "Use default location" allows you to
       change the location on disk where the project's files will be
       generated and stored. "Build Target" is the platform target that
       your application will be compiled against (this should be selected
       automatically, based on your Min SDK Version).
       Notice that the "Build Target" you've selected uses the Android 1.1
       platform. This means that your application will be compiled against
       the Android 1.1 platform library. If you recall, the AVD created
       above runs on the Android 1.5 platform. These don't have to match;
       Android applications are forward-compatible, so an application
       built against the 1.1 platform library will run normally on the 1.5
       platform. The reverse is not true.

   Your Android project is now ready. It should be visible in the Package
   Explorer on the left. Open the HelloAndroid.java file, located inside
   HelloAndroid > src > com.example.helloandroid). It should look like
   this:
package com.example.helloandroid;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class HelloAndroid extends Activity {
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);
    }
}

   Notice that the class is based on the Activity class. An Activity is a
   single application entity that is used to perform actions. An
   application may have many separate activities, but the user interacts
   with them one at a time. The onCreate() method will be called by the
   Android system when your Activity starts — it is where you should
   perform all initialization and UI setup. An activity is not required to
   have a user interface, but usually will.

   Now let's modify some code!

Construct the UI

   Take a look at the revised code below and then make the same changes to
   your HelloAndroid class. The bold items are lines that have been added.
package com.android.helloandroid;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.widget.TextView;

public class HelloAndroid extends Activity {
   /** Called when the activity is first created. */
   @Override
   public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
       TextView tv = new TextView(this);
       tv.setText("Hello, Android");
       setContentView(tv);
   }
}

   Tip: An easy way to add import packages to your project is to press
   Ctrl-Shift-O (Cmd-Shift-O, on Mac). This is an Eclipse shortcut that
   identifies missing packages based on your code and adds them for you.

   An Android user interface is composed of hierarchies of objects called
   Views. A View is a drawable object used as an element in your UI
   layout, such as a button, image, or (in this case) a text label. Each
   of these objects is a subclass of the View class and the subclass that
   handles text is TextView.

   In this change, you create a TextView with the class constructor, which
   accepts an Android Context instance as its parameter. A Context is a
   handle to the system; it provides services like resolving resources,
   obtaining access to databases and preferences, and so on. The Activity
   class inherits from Context, and because your HelloAndroid class is a
   subclass of Activity, it is also a Context. So, you can pass this as
   your Context reference to the TextView.

   Next, you define the text content with setText(CharSequence) setText().

   Finally, you pass the TextView to setContentView() in order to display
   it as the content for the Activity UI. If your Activity doesn't call
   this method, then no UI is present and the system will display a blank
   screen.

   There it is — "Hello, World" in Android! The next step, of course, is
   to see it running.

Run the Application

   The Eclipse plugin makes it very easy to run your applications:
    1. Select Run > Run.
    2. Select "Android Application".

   To learn more about creating and editing run configurations in Eclipse,
   refer to Developing In Eclipse, with ADT.

   The Eclipse ADT will automatically create a new run configuration for
   your project and the Android Emulator will automatically launch. Once
   the emulator is booted up, your application will appear after a moment.
   You should now see something like this:

   The "Hello, Android" you see in the grey bar is actually the
   application title. The Eclipse plugin creates this automatically (the
   string is defined in the res/values/strings.xml file and referenced by
   your AndroidManifest.xml file). The text below the title is the actual
   text that you have created in the TextView object.

   That concludes the basic "Hello World" tutorial, but you should
   continue reading for some more valuable information about developing
   Android applications.

Upgrade the UI to an XML Layout

   The "Hello, World" example you just completed uses what is called a
   "programmatic" UI layout. This means that you constructed and built
   your application's UI directly in source code. If you've done much UI
   programming, you're probably familiar with how brittle that approach
   can sometimes be: small changes in layout can result in big source-code
   headaches. It's also very easy to forget to properly connect Views
   together, which can result in errors in your layout and wasted time
   debugging your code.

   That's why Android provides an alternate UI construction model:
   XML-based layout files. The easiest way to explain this concept is to
   show an example. Here's an XML layout file that is identical in
   behavior to the programmatically-constructed example:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<TextView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:layout_width="fill_parent"
  android:layout_height="fill_parent"
  android:text="@string/hello"/>

   The general structure of an Android XML layout file is simple: it's a
   tree of XML elements, wherein each node is the name of a View class
   (this example, however, is just one View element). You can use the name
   of any class that extends View as an element in your XML layouts,
   including custom View classes you define in your own code. This
   structure makes it very easy to quickly build up UIs, using a more
   simple structure and syntax than you would use in a programmatic
   layout. This model is inspired by the web development model, wherein
   you can separate the presentation of your application (its UI) from the
   application logic used to fetch and fill in data.

   In the above XML example, there's just one View element: the TextView,
   which has four XML attributes. Here's a summary of what they mean:
   Attribute Meaning
   xmlns:android This is an XML namespace declaration that tells the
   Android tools that you are going to refer to common attributes defined
   in the Android namespace. The outermost tag in every Android layout
   file must have this attribute.
   android:layout_width This attribute defines how much of the available
   width on the screen this View should consume. In this case, it's the
   only View so you want it to take up the entire screen, which is what a
   value of "fill_parent" means.
   android:layout_height This is just like android:layout_width, except
   that it refers to available screen height.
   android:text This sets the text that the TextView should display. In
   this example, you use a string resource instead of a hard-coded string
   value. The hello string is defined in the res/values/strings.xml file.
   This is the recommended practice for inserting strings to your
   application, because it makes the localization of your application to
   other languages graceful, without need to hard-code changes to the
   layout file. For more information, see Resources and
   Internationalization.

   These XML layout files belong in the res/layout/ directory of your
   project. The "res" is short for "resources" and the directory contains
   all the non-code assets that your application requires. In addition to
   layout files, resources also include assets such as images, sounds, and
   localized strings.

Landscape layout

   When you want a different design for landscape, put your layout XML
   file inside /res/layout-land. Android will automatically look here when
   the layout changes. Without this special landscape layout defined,
   Android will stretch the default layout.

   The Eclipse plugin automatically creates one of these layout files for
   you: main.xml. In the "Hello World" application you just completed,
   this file was ignored and you created a layout programmatically. This
   was meant to teach you more about the Android framework, but you should
   almost always define your layout in an XML file instead of in your
   code. The following procedures will instruct you how to change your
   existing application to use an XML layout.
    1. In the Eclipse Package Explorer, expand the /res/layout/ folder and
       open main.xml (once opened, you might need to click the "main.xml"
       tab at the bottom of the window to see the XML source). Replace the
       contents with the following XML:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<TextView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:layout_width="fill_parent"
  android:layout_height="fill_parent"
  android:text="@string/hello"/>
       Save the file.
    2. Inside the res/values/ folder, open strings.xml. This is where you
       should save all default text strings for your user interface. If
       you're using Eclipse, then ADT will have started you with two
       strings, hello and app_name. Revise hello to something else.
       Perhaps "Hello, Android! I am a string resource!" The entire file
       should now look like this:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="hello">Hello, Android! I am a string resource!</string>
    <string name="app_name">Hello, Android</string>
</resources>

    3. Now open and modify your HelloAndroid class use the XML layout.
       Edit the file to look like this:
package com.example.helloandroid;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class HelloAndroid extends Activity {
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);
    }
}
       When you make this change, type it by hand to try the
       code-completion feature. As you begin typing "R.layout.main" the
       plugin will offer you suggestions. You'll find that it helps in a
       lot of situations.
       Instead of passing setContentView() a View object, you give it a
       reference to the layout resource. The resource is identified as
       R.layout.main, which is actually a compiled object representation
       of the layout defined in /res/layout/main.xml. The Eclipse plugin
       automatically creates this reference for you inside the project's
       R.java class. If you're not using Eclipse, then the R.java class
       will be generated for you when you run Ant to build the
       application. (More about the R class in a moment.)

   Now re-run your application — because you've created a launch
   configuration, all you need to do is click the green arrow icon to run,
   or select Run > Run History > Android Activity. Other than the change
   to the TextView string, the application looks the same. After all, the
   point was to show that the two different layout approaches produce
   identical results.

   Tip: Use the shortcut Ctrl-F11 (Cmd-Shift-F11, on Mac) to run your
   currently visible application.

   Continue reading for an introduction to debugging and a little more
   information on using other IDEs. When you're ready to learn more, read
   Application Fundamentals for an introduction to all the elements that
   make Android applications work. Also refer to the Developer's Guide
   introduction page for an overview of the Dev Guide documentation.

R class

   In Eclipse, open the file named R.java (in the gen/ [Generated Java
   Files] folder). It should look something like this:
package com.example.helloandroid;

public final class R {
    public static final class attr {
    }
    public static final class drawable {
        public static final int icon=0x7f020000;
    }
    public static final class layout {
        public static final int main=0x7f030000;
    }
    public static final class string {
        public static final int app_name=0x7f040001;
        public static final int hello=0x7f040000;
    }
}

   A project's R.java file is an index into all the resources defined in
   the file. You use this class in your source code as a sort of
   short-hand way to refer to resources you've included in your project.
   This is particularly powerful with the code-completion features of IDEs
   like Eclipse because it lets you quickly and interactively locate the
   specific reference you're looking for.

   It's possible yours looks slighly different than this (perhaps the
   hexadecimal values are different). For now, notice the inner class
   named "layout", and its member field "main". The Eclipse plugin noticed
   the XML layout file named main.xml and generated a class for it here.
   As you add other resources to your project (such as strings in the
   res/values/string.xml file or drawables inside the res/drawable/
   direcory) you'll see R.java change to keep up.

   When not using Eclipse, this class file will be generated for you at
   build time (with the Ant tool).

   You should never edit this file by hand.

Debug Your Project

   The Android Plugin for Eclipse also has excellent integration with the
   Eclipse debugger. To demonstrate this, introduce a bug into your code.
   Change your HelloAndroid source code to look like this:
package com.android.helloandroid;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class HelloAndroid extends Activity {
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        Object o = null;
        o.toString();
        setContentView(R.layout.main);
    }
}

   This change simply introduces a NullPointerException into your code. If
   you run your application again, you'll eventually see this:

   Press "Force Quit" to terminate the application and close the emulator
   window.

   To find out more about the error, set a breakpoint in your source code
   on the line Object o = null; (double-click on the marker bar next to
   the source code line). Then select Run > Debug History > Hello, Android
   from the menu to enter debug mode. Your app will restart in the
   emulator, but this time it will suspend when it reaches the breakpoint
   you set. You can then step through the code in Eclipse's Debug
   Perspective, just as you would for any other application.

Creating the Project without Eclipse

   If you don't use Eclipse (such as if you prefer another IDE, or simply
   use text editors and command line tools) then the Eclipse plugin can't
   help you. Don't worry though — you don't lose any functionality just
   because you don't use Eclipse.

   The Android Plugin for Eclipse is really just a wrapper around a set of
   tools included with the Android SDK. (These tools, like the emulator,
   aapt, adb, ddms, and others are documented elsewhere.) Thus, it's
   possible to wrap those tools with another tool, such as an 'ant' build
   file.

   The Android SDK includes a tool named "android" that can be used to
   create all the source code and directory stubs for your project, as
   well as an ant-compatible build.xml file. This allows you to build your
   project from the command line, or integrate it with the IDE of your
   choice.

   For example, to create a HelloAndroid project similar to the one
   created in Eclipse, use this command:
android create project \
    --package com.android.helloandroid \
    --activity HelloAndroid \
    --target 2 \
    --path <path-to-your-project>/HelloAndroid

   This creates the required folders and files for the project at the
   location defined by the path.

   For more information on how to use the SDK tools to create and build
   projects, please read Developing in Other IDEs.
