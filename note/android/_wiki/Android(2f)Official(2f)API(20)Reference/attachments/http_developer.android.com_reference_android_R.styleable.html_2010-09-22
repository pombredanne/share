public static final int AndroidManifestActivityAlias_description

   Since: API Level

   Descriptive text for the associated data.

   Must be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol description.
   Constant Value: 6 (0x00000006)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivityAlias_enabled

   Since: API Level

   Specify whether the activity-alias is enabled or not (that is, can be
   instantiated by the system). It can also be specified for an
   application as a whole, in which case a value of "false" will override
   any component specific values (a value of "true" will not override the
   component specific values).

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol enabled.
   Constant Value: 4 (0x00000004)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivityAlias_exported

   Since: API Level

   Flag indicating whether the given application component is available to
   other applications. If false, it can only be accessed by applications
   with its same user id (which usually means only by code in its own
   package). If true, it can be invoked by external entities, though which
   ones can do so may be controlled through permissions. The default value
   is false for activity, receiver, and service components that do not
   specify any intent filters; it is true for activity, receiver, and
   service components that do have intent filters (implying they expect to
   be invoked by others who do not know their particular component name)
   and for all content providers.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol exported.
   Constant Value: 5 (0x00000005)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivityAlias_icon

   Since: API Level

   A Drawable resource providing a graphical representation of its
   associated item. Use with the application tag (to supply a default icon
   for all application components), or with the activity, receiver,
   service, or instrumentation tag (to supply a specific icon for that
   component). It may also be used with the intent-filter tag to supply an
   icon to show to the user when an activity is being selected based on a
   particular Intent.

   The given icon will be used to display to the user a graphical
   representation of its associated component; for example, as the icon
   for main activity that is displayed in the launcher. This must be a
   reference to a Drawable resource containing the image definition.

   Must be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol icon.
   Constant Value: 1 (0x00000001)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivityAlias_label

   Since: API Level

   A user-legible name for the given item. Use with the application tag
   (to supply a default label for all application components), or with the
   activity, receiver, service, or instrumentation tag (to supply a
   specific label for that component). It may also be used with the
   intent-filter tag to supply a label to show to the user when an
   activity is being selected based on a particular Intent.

   The given label will be used wherever the user sees information about
   its associated component; for example, as the name of a main activity
   that is displayed in the launcher. You should generally set this to a
   reference to a string resource, so that it can be localized, however it
   is also allowed to supply a plain string for quick and dirty
   programming.

   May be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   May be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol label.
   Constant Value: 0 (0x00000000)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivityAlias_name

   Since: API Level

   Required name of the class implementing the activity, deriving from
   Activity. This is a fully qualified class name (for example,
   com.mycompany.myapp.MyActivity); as a short-hand if the first character
   of the class is a period then it is appended to your package name.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol name.
   Constant Value: 2 (0x00000002)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivityAlias_permission

   Since: API Level

   Specify a permission that a client is required to have in order to use
   the associated object. If the client does not hold the named
   permission, its request will fail. See the Security and Permissions
   document for more information on permissions.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol permission.
   Constant Value: 3 (0x00000003)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivityAlias_targetActivity

   Since: API Level

   The name of the activity this alias should launch. The activity must be
   in the same manifest as the alias, and have been defined in that
   manifest before the alias here. This must use a Java-style naming
   convention to ensure the name is unique, for example
   "com.mycompany.MyName".

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   targetActivity.
   Constant Value: 7 (0x00000007)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_allowTaskReparenting

   Since: API Level

   Specify that an activity can be moved out of a task it is in to the
   task it has an affinity for when appropriate. Use with the application
   tag (to supply a default for all activities in the application), or
   with an activity tag (to supply a specific setting for that component).

   Normally when an application is started, it is associated with the task
   of the activity that started it and stays there for its entire
   lifetime. You can use the allowTaskReparenting feature to force an
   activity to be re-parented to a different task when the task it is in
   goes to the background. Typically this is used to cause the activities
   of an application to move back to the main task associated with that
   application. The activity is re-parented to the task with the same
   taskAffinity as it has.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   allowTaskReparenting.
   Constant Value: 19 (0x00000013)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_alwaysRetainTaskState

   Since: API Level

   Specify whether an acitivty's task state should always be maintained by
   the system, or if it is allowed to reset the task to its initial state
   in certain situations.

   Normally the system will reset a task (remove all activities from the
   stack and reset the root activity) in certain situations when the user
   re-selects that task from the home screen. Typically this will be done
   if the user hasn't visited that task for a certain amount of time, such
   as 30 minutes.

   By setting this attribute, the user will always return to your task in
   its last state, regardless of how they get there. This is useful, for
   example, in an application like the web browser where there is a lot of
   state (such as multiple open tabs) that the application would not like
   to lose.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   alwaysRetainTaskState.
   Constant Value: 18 (0x00000012)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_clearTaskOnLaunch

   Since: API Level

   Specify whether an activity's task should be cleared when it is
   re-launched from the home screen. As a result, every time the user
   starts the task, they will be brought to its root activity, regardless
   of whether they used BACK or HOME to last leave it. This flag only
   applies to activities that are used to start the root of a new task.

   An example of the use of this flag would be for the case where a user
   launches activity A from home, and from there goes to activity B. They
   now press home, and then return to activity A. Normally they would see
   activity B, since that is what they were last doing in A's task.
   However, if A has set this flag to true, then upon going to the
   background all of the tasks on top of it (B in this case) are removed,
   so when the user next returns to A they will restart at its original
   activity.

   When this option is used in conjunction with allowTaskReparenting, the
   allowTaskReparenting trumps the clear. That is, all activities above
   the root activity of the task will be removed: those that have an
   affinity will be moved to the task they are associated with, otherwise
   they will simply be dropped as described here.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   clearTaskOnLaunch.
   Constant Value: 11 (0x0000000b)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_configChanges

   Since: API Level

   Specify one or more configuration changes that the activity will handle
   itself. If not specified, the activity will be restarted if any of
   these configuration changes happen in the system. Otherwise, the
   activity will remain running and its Activity.onConfigurationChanged
   method called with the new configuration.

   Note that all of these configuration changes can impact the resource
   values seen by the application, so you will generally need to
   re-retrieve all resources (including view layouts, drawables, etc) to
   correctly handle any configuration change.

   These values must be kept in sync with those in ActivityInfo and
   include/utils/ResourceTypes.h.

   Must be one or more (separated by '|') of the following constant
   values.
   Constant Value Description
   mcc 0x0001 The IMSI MCC has changed, that is a SIM has been detected
   and updated the Mobile Country Code.
   mnc 0x0002 The IMSI MNC has changed, that is a SIM has been detected
   and updated the Mobile Network Code.
   locale 0x0004 The locale has changed, that is the user has selected a
   new language that text should be displayed in.
   touchscreen 0x0008 The touchscreen has changed. Should never normally
   happen.
   keyboard 0x0010 The keyboard type has changed, for example the user has
   plugged in an external keyboard.
   keyboardHidden 0x0020 The keyboard or navigation accessibility has
   changed, for example the user has slid the keyboard out to expose it.
   Note that despite its name, this applied to any accessibility: keyboard
   or navigation.
   navigation 0x0040 The navigation type has changed. Should never
   normally happen.
   orientation 0x0080 The screen orientation has changed, that is the user
   has rotated the device.
   screenLayout 0x0100 The screen layout has changed. This might be caused
   by a different display being activated.
   uiMode 0x0200 The global user interface mode has changed. For example,
   going in or out of car mode, night mode changing, etc.
   fontScale 0x40000000 The font scaling factor has changed, that is the
   user has selected a new global font size.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol configChanges.

   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol exported.
   Constant Value: 6 (0x00000006)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_finishOnCloseSystemDialogs

   Since: API Level

   Specify whether an activity should be finished when a "close system
   windows" request has been made. This happens, for example, when the
   home key is pressed, when the device is locked, when a system dialog
   showing recent applications is displayed, etc.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   finishOnCloseSystemDialogs.
   Constant Value: 22 (0x00000016)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_finishOnTaskLaunch

   Since: API Level

   Specify whether an activity should be finished when its task is brought
   to the foreground by relaunching from the home screen.

   If both this option and allowTaskReparenting are specified, the finish
   trumps the affinity: the affinity will be ignored and the activity
   simply finished.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   finishOnTaskLaunch.
   Constant Value: 10 (0x0000000a)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_icon

   Since: API Level

   A Drawable resource providing a graphical representation of its
   associated item. Use with the application tag (to supply a default icon
   for all application components), or with the activity, receiver,
   service, or instrumentation tag (to supply a specific icon for that
   component). It may also be used with the intent-filter tag to supply an
   icon to show to the user when an activity is being selected based on a
   particular Intent.

   The given icon will be used to display to the user a graphical
   representation of its associated component; for example, as the icon
   for main activity that is displayed in the launcher. This must be a
   reference to a Drawable resource containing the image definition.

   Must be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol icon.
   Constant Value: 2 (0x00000002)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_label

   Since: API Level

   A user-legible name for the given item. Use with the application tag
   (to supply a default label for all application components), or with the
   activity, receiver, service, or instrumentation tag (to supply a
   specific label for that component). It may also be used with the
   intent-filter tag to supply a label to show to the user when an
   activity is being selected based on a particular Intent.

   The given label will be used wherever the user sees information about
   its associated component; for example, as the name of a main activity
   that is displayed in the launcher. You should generally set this to a
   reference to a string resource, so that it can be localized, however it
   is also allowed to supply a plain string for quick and dirty
   programming.

   May be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   May be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol label.
   Constant Value: 1 (0x00000001)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_launchMode

   Since: API Level

   Specify how an activity should be launched. See the Application
   Fundamentals documentation for important information on how these
   options impact the behavior of your application.

   If this attribute is not specified, standard launch mode will be used.
   Note that the particular launch behavior can be changed in some ways at
   runtime through the Intent flags FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP,
   FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK, and FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK.

   Must be one of the following constant values.
   Constant Value Description
   standard 0 The default mode, which will usually create a new instance
   of the activity when it is started, though this behavior may change
   with the introduction of other options such as
   Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK.
   singleTop 1 If, when starting the activity, there is already an
   instance of the same activity class in the foreground that is
   interacting with the user, then re-use that instance. This existing
   instance will receive a call to Activity.onNewIntent() with the new
   Intent that is being started.
   singleTask 2 If, when starting the activity, there is already a task
   running that starts with this activity, then instead of starting a new
   instance the current task is brought to the front. The existing
   instance will receive a call to Activity.onNewIntent() with the new
   Intent that is being started, and with the
   Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_BROUGHT_TO_FRONT flag set. This is a superset of
   the singleTop mode, where if there is already an instance of the
   activity being started at the top of the stack, it will receive the
   Intent as described there (without the FLAG_ACTIVITY_BROUGHT_TO_FRONT
   flag set). See the Application Fundamentals documentation for more
   details on tasks.
   singleInstance 3 Only allow one instance of this activity to ever be
   running. This activity gets a unique task with only itself running in
   it; if it is ever launched again with the same Intent, then that task
   will be brought forward and its Activity.onNewIntent() method called.
   If this activity tries to start a new activity, that new activity will
   be launched in a separate task. See the Application Fundamentals
   documentation for more details on tasks.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol launchMode.
   Constant Value: 14 (0x0000000e)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_multiprocess

   Since: API Level

   Specify whether a component is allowed to have multiple instances of
   itself running in different processes. Use with the activity and
   provider tags.

   Normally the system will ensure that all instances of a particular
   component are only running in a single process. You can use this
   attribute to disable that behavior, allowing the system to create
   instances wherever they are used (provided permissions allow it). This
   is most often used with content providers, so that instances of a
   provider can be created in each client process, allowing them to be
   used without performing IPC.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol multiprocess.
   Constant Value: 9 (0x00000009)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_name

   Since: API Level

   Required name of the class implementing the activity, deriving from
   Activity. This is a fully qualified class name (for example,
   com.mycompany.myapp.MyActivity); as a short-hand if the first character
   of the class is a period then it is appended to your package name.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol name.
   Constant Value: 3 (0x00000003)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_noHistory

   Since: API Level

   Specify whether an activity should be kept in its history stack. If
   this attribute is set, then as soon as the user navigates away from the
   activity it will be finished and they will no longer be able to return
   to it.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol noHistory.
   Constant Value: 21 (0x00000015)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_permission

   Since: API Level

   Specify a permission that a client is required to have in order to use
   the associated object. If the client does not hold the named
   permission, its request will fail. See the Security and Permissions
   document for more information on permissions.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol permission.
   Constant Value: 4 (0x00000004)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_process

   Since: API Level

   Specify a specific process that the associated code is to run in. Use
   with the application tag (to supply a default process for all
   application components), or with the activity, receiver, service, or
   provider tag (to supply a specific icon for that component).

   Application components are normally run in a single process that is
   created for the entire application. You can use this tag to modify
   where they run. If the process name begins with a ':' character, a new
   process private to that application will be created when needed to run
   that component (allowing you to spread your application across multiple
   processes). If the process name begins with a lower-case character, the
   component will be run in a global process of that name, provided that
   you have permission to do so, allowing multiple applications to share
   one process to reduce resource usage.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol process.
   Constant Value: 7 (0x00000007)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_screenOrientation

   Since: API Level

   Specify the orientation an activity should be run in. If not specified,
   it will run in the current preferred orientation of the screen.

   Must be one of the following constant values.
   Constant Value Description
   unspecified -1 No preference specified: let the system decide the best
   orientation. This will either be the orientation selected by the
   activity below, or the user's preferred orientation if this activity is
   the bottom of a task. If the user explicitly turned off sensor based
   orientation through settings sensor based device rotation will be
   ignored. If not by default sensor based orientation will be taken into
   account and the orientation will changed based on how the user rotates
   the device
   landscape 0 Would like to have the screen in a landscape orientation:
   that is, with the display wider than it is tall.
   portrait 1 Would like to have the screen in a portrait orientation:
   that is, with the display taller than it is wide.
   user 2 Use the user's current preferred orientation of the handset.
   behind 3 Keep the screen in the same orientation as whatever is behind
   this activity.
   sensor 4 Orientation is determined by a physical orientation sensor:
   the display will rotate based on how the user moves the device.
   nosensor 5 Always ignore orientation determined by orientation sensor:
   the display will not rotate when the user moves the device.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   screenOrientation.
   Constant Value: 15 (0x0000000f)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_stateNotNeeded

   Since: API Level

   Indicates that an Activity does not need to have its freeze state (as
   returned by onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) retained in order to be
   restarted. Generally you use this for activities that do not store any
   state. When this flag is set, if for some reason the activity is killed
   before it has a chance to save its state, then the system will not
   remove it from the activity stack like it normally would. Instead, the
   next time the user navigates to it its onCreate(Bundle) method will be
   called with a null icicle, just like it was starting for the first
   time.

   This is used by the Home activity to make sure it does not get removed
   if it crashes for some reason.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   stateNotNeeded.
   Constant Value: 12 (0x0000000c)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_taskAffinity

   Since: API Level

   Specify a task name that activities have an "affinity" to. Use with the
   application tag (to supply a default affinity for all activities in the
   application), or with the activity tag (to supply a specific affinity
   for that component).

   The default value for this attribute is the same as the package name,
   indicating that all activities in the manifest should generally be
   considered a single "application" to the user. You can use this
   attribute to modify that behavior: either giving them an affinity for
   another task, if the activities are intended to be part of that task
   from the user's perspective, or using an empty string for activities
   that have no affinity to a task.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol taskAffinity.
   Constant Value: 8 (0x00000008)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_theme

   Since: API Level

   The overall theme to use for an activity. Use with either the
   application tag (to supply a default theme for all activities) or the
   activity tag (to supply a specific theme for that activity).

   This automatically sets your activity's Context to use this theme, and
   may also be used for "starting" animations prior to the activity being
   launched (to better match what the activity actually looks like). It is
   a reference to a style resource defining the theme. If not set, the
   default system theme will be used.

   Must be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol theme.
   Constant Value: 0 (0x00000000)

public static final int AndroidManifestActivity_windowSoftInputMode

   Since: API Level

   Specify the default soft-input mode for the main window of this
   activity. A value besides "unspecified" here overrides any value in the
   theme.

   Must be one or more (separated by '|') of the following constant
   values.
   Constant Value Description
   stateUnspecified 0 Not specified, use what the system thinks is best.
   This is the default.
   stateUnchanged 1 Leave the soft input window as-is, in whatever state
   it last was.
   stateHidden 2 Make the soft input area hidden when normally appropriate
   (when the user is navigating forward to your window).
   stateAlwaysHidden 3 Always make the soft input area hidden when this
   window has input focus.
   stateVisible 4 Make the soft input area visible when normally
   appropriate (when the user is navigating forward to your window).
   stateAlwaysVisible 5 Always make the soft input area visible when this
   window has input focus.
   adjustUnspecified 0x00 The window resize/pan adjustment has not been
   specified, the system will automatically select between resize and pan
   modes, depending on whether the content of the window has any layout
   views that can scroll their contents. If there is such a view, then the
   window will be resized, with the assumption being that the resizeable
   area can be reduced to make room for the input UI.
   adjustResize 0x10 Always resize the window: the content area of the
   window is reduced to make room for the soft input area.
   adjustPan 0x20 Don't resize the window to make room for the soft input
   area; instead pan the contents of the window as focus moves inside of
   it so that the user can see what they are typing. This is generally
   less desireable than panning because the user may need to close the
   input area to get at and interact with parts of the window.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   windowSoftInputMode.
   Constant Value: 20 (0x00000014)

public static final int[] AndroidManifestApplication

   Since: API Level

   The application tag describes application-level components contained in
   the package, as well as general application attributes. Many of the
   attributes you can supply here (such as theme, label, icon, permission,
   process, taskAffinity, and allowTaskReparenting) serve as default
   values for the corresponding attributes of components declared inside
   of the application.

   Inside of this element you specify what the application contains, using
   the elements provider, service, receiver, activity, activity-alias, and
   uses-library. The application tag appears as a child of the root
   manifest tag.

   Includes the following attributes:
   Attribute Description
   android:allowBackup Whether to allow the application to participate in
   backup infrastructure.
   android:allowClearUserData Option to let applications specify that user
   data can/cannot be cleared.
   android:allowTaskReparenting Specify that an activity can be moved out
   of a task it is in to the task it has an affinity for when appropriate.
   android:backupAgent The name of the class subclassing BackupAgent to
   manage backup and restore of the application's data on external
   storage.
   android:debuggable Flag indicating whether the application can be
   debugged, even when running on a device that is running in user mode.
   android:description Descriptive text for the associated data.
   android:enabled Specify whether the components in this application are
   enabled or not (that is, can be instantiated by the system).
   android:hasCode Indicate whether this application contains code.
   android:icon A Drawable resource providing a graphical representation
   of its associated item.
   android:killAfterRestore Whether the application in question should be
   terminated after its settings have been restored during a full-system
   restore operation.
   android:label A user-legible name for the given item.
   android:manageSpaceActivity Name of activity to be launched for
   managing the application's space on the device.
   android:name An optional name of a class implementing the overall
   Application for this package.
   android:permission Specify a permission that a client is required to
   have in order to use the associated object.
   android:persistent Flag to control special persistent mode of an
   application.
   android:process Specify a specific process that the associated code is
   to run in.
   android:restoreAnyVersion Indicate that the application is prepared to
   attempt a restore of any backed-up dataset, even if the backup is
   apparently from a newer version of the application than is currently
   installed on the device.
   android:restoreNeedsApplication @deprecated This attribute is not used
   by the Android operating system.
   android:taskAffinity Specify a task name that activities have an
   "affinity" to.
   android:testOnly Option to indicate this application is only for

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_allowBackup

   Since: API Level

   Whether to allow the application to participate in backup
   infrastructure. If this attribute is set to false, no backup of the
   application will ever be performed, even by a full-system backup that
   would otherwise cause all application data to be saved via adb. The
   default value of this attribute is true.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol allowBackup.
   Constant Value: 17 (0x00000011)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_allowClearUserData

   Since: API Level

   Option to let applications specify that user data can/cannot be
   cleared. Some applications might not want to clear user data. Such
   applications can explicitly set this value to false. This flag is
   turned on by default unless explicitly set to false by applications.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   allowClearUserData.
   Constant Value: 5 (0x00000005)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_allowTaskReparenting

   Since: API Level

   Specify that an activity can be moved out of a task it is in to the
   task it has an affinity for when appropriate. Use with the application
   tag (to supply a default for all activities in the application), or
   with an activity tag (to supply a specific setting for that component).

   Normally when an application is started, it is associated with the task
   of the activity that started it and stays there for its entire
   lifetime. You can use the allowTaskReparenting feature to force an
   activity to be re-parented to a different task when the task it is in
   goes to the background. Typically this is used to cause the activities
   of an application to move back to the main task associated with that
   application. The activity is re-parented to the task with the same
   taskAffinity as it has.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   allowTaskReparenting.
   Constant Value: 14 (0x0000000e)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_backupAgent

   Since: API Level

   The name of the class subclassing BackupAgent to manage backup and
   restore of the application's data on external storage.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol backupAgent.
   Constant Value: 16 (0x00000010)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_debuggable

   Since: API Level

   Flag indicating whether the application can be debugged, even when
   running on a device that is running in user mode.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol debuggable.
   Constant Value: 10 (0x0000000a)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_description

   Since: API Level

   Descriptive text for the associated data.

   Must be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol description.
   Constant Value: 13 (0x0000000d)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_enabled

   Since: API Level

   Specify whether the components in this application are enabled or not
   (that is, can be instantiated by the system). If "false", it overrides
   any component specific values (a value of "true" will not override the
   component specific values).

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol enabled.
   Constant Value: 9 (0x00000009)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_hasCode

   Since: API Level

   Indicate whether this application contains code. If set to false, there
   is no code associated with it and thus the system will not try to load
   its code when launching components. The default is true for normal
   behavior.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol hasCode.
   Constant Value: 7 (0x00000007)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_icon

   Since: API Level

   A Drawable resource providing a graphical representation of its
   associated item. Use with the application tag (to supply a default icon
   for all application components), or with the activity, receiver,
   service, or instrumentation tag (to supply a specific icon for that
   component). It may also be used with the intent-filter tag to supply an
   icon to show to the user when an activity is being selected based on a
   particular Intent.

   The given icon will be used to display to the user a graphical
   representation of its associated component; for example, as the icon
   for main activity that is displayed in the launcher. This must be a
   reference to a Drawable resource containing the image definition.

   Must be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol icon.
   Constant Value: 2 (0x00000002)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_killAfterRestore

   Since: API Level

   Whether the application in question should be terminated after its
   settings have been restored during a full-system restore operation.
   Single-package restore operations will never cause the application to
   be shut down. Full-system restore operations typically only occur once,
   when the phone is first set up. Third-party applications will not
   usually need to use this attribute.

   The default is true, which means that after the application has
   finished processing its data during a full-system restore, it will be
   terminated.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   killAfterRestore.
   Constant Value: 18 (0x00000012)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_label

   Since: API Level

   A user-legible name for the given item. Use with the application tag
   (to supply a default label for all application components), or with the
   activity, receiver, service, or instrumentation tag (to supply a
   specific label for that component). It may also be used with the
   intent-filter tag to supply a label to show to the user when an
   activity is being selected based on a particular Intent.

   The given label will be used wherever the user sees information about
   its associated component; for example, as the name of a main activity
   that is displayed in the launcher. You should generally set this to a
   reference to a string resource, so that it can be localized, however it
   is also allowed to supply a plain string for quick and dirty
   programming.

   May be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   May be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol label.
   Constant Value: 1 (0x00000001)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_manageSpaceActivity

   Since: API Level

   Name of activity to be launched for managing the application's space on
   the device.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   manageSpaceActivity.
   Constant Value: 4 (0x00000004)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_name

   Since: API Level

   An optional name of a class implementing the overall Application for
   this package. When the process for your package is started, this class
   is instantiated before any of the other application components. Note
   that this is not required, and in fact most applications will probably
   not need it.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol name.
   Constant Value: 3 (0x00000003)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_permission

   Since: API Level

   Specify a permission that a client is required to have in order to use
   the associated object. If the client does not hold the named
   permission, its request will fail. See the Security and Permissions
   document for more information on permissions.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form

   not normally be used by applications; it requires that the system keep
   your application running at all times.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol persistent.
   Constant Value: 8 (0x00000008)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_process

   Since: API Level

   Specify a specific process that the associated code is to run in. Use
   with the application tag (to supply a default process for all
   application components), or with the activity, receiver, service, or
   provider tag (to supply a specific icon for that component).

   Application components are normally run in a single process that is
   created for the entire application. You can use this tag to modify
   where they run. If the process name begins with a ':' character, a new
   process private to that application will be created when needed to run
   that component (allowing you to spread your application across multiple
   processes). If the process name begins with a lower-case character, the
   component will be run in a global process of that name, provided that
   you have permission to do so, allowing multiple applications to share
   one process to reduce resource usage.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol process.
   Constant Value: 11 (0x0000000b)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_restoreAnyVersion

   Since: API Level

   Indicate that the application is prepared to attempt a restore of any
   backed-up dataset, even if the backup is apparently from a newer
   version of the application than is currently installed on the device.
   Setting this attribute to true will permit the Backup Manager to
   attempt restore even when a version mismatch suggests that the data are
   incompatible. Use with caution!

   The default value of this attribute is false.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   restoreAnyVersion.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   restoreNeedsApplication.

   Constant Value: 19 (0x00000013)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_taskAffinity

   Since: API Level

   Specify a task name that activities have an "affinity" to. Use with the
   application tag (to supply a default affinity for all activities in the
   application), or with the activity tag (to supply a specific affinity
   for that component).

   The default value for this attribute is the same as the package name,
   indicating that all activities in the manifest should generally be
   considered a single "application" to the user. You can use this
   attribute to modify that behavior: either giving them an affinity for
   another task, if the activities are intended to be part of that task
   from the user's perspective, or using an empty string for activities
   that have no affinity to a task.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol taskAffinity.
   Constant Value: 12 (0x0000000c)

public static final int AndroidManifestApplication_testOnly

   Since: API Level

   Option to indicate this application is only for testing purposes. For
   example, it may expose functionality or data outside of itself that
   would cause a security hole, but is useful for testing. This kind of
   application can not be installed without the INSTALL_ALLOW_TEST flag,
   which means only through adb install.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   Since: API Level

   The overall theme to use for an activity. Use with either the
   application tag (to supply a default theme for all activities) or the
   activity tag (to supply a specific theme for that activity).

   This automatically sets your activity's Context to use this theme, and
   may also be used for "starting" animations prior to the activity being
   launched (to better match what the activity actually looks like). It is
   a reference to a style resource defining the theme. If not set, the
   default system theme will be used.

   Must be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol theme.

   child of the intent-filter tag, describing the types of data that
   match. This tag can be specified multiple times to supply multiple data
   options, as described in the IntentFilter class. Note that all such
   tags are adding options to the same IntentFilter so that, for example,

   A user-legible name for the given item. Use with the application tag
   (to supply a default label for all application components), or with the
   activity, receiver, service, or instrumentation tag (to supply a
   specific label for that component). It may also be used with the
   intent-filter tag to supply a label to show to the user when an
   activity is being selected based on a particular Intent.

   The given label will be used wherever the user sees information about
   its associated component; for example, as the name of a main activity
   that is displayed in the launcher. You should generally set this to a
   reference to a string resource, so that it can be localized, however it
   is also allowed to supply a plain string for quick and dirty
   programming.

   May be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   May be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol label.
   Constant Value: 0 (0x00000000)

public static final int AndroidManifestIntentFilter_priority

   Since: API Level

   Specify the relative importance or ability in handling a particular
   Intent. For receivers, this controls the order in which they are
   executed to receive a broadcast (note that for asynchronous broadcasts,
   this order is ignored). For activities, this provides information about
   how good an activity is handling an Intent; when multiple activities
   match an intent and have different priorities, only those with the
   higher priority value will be considered a match.

   Only use if you really need to impose some specific order in which the
   broadcasts are received, or want to forcibly place an activity to
   always be preferred over others. The value is a single integer, with
   higher numbers considered to be better.

   Must be an integer value, such as "100".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol priority.
   Constant Value: 2 (0x00000002)

public static final int[] AndroidManifestMetaData

   Since: API Level

   The meta-data tag is used to attach additional arbitrary data to an
   application component. The data can later be retrieved programmatically
   from the ComponentInfo.metaData field. There is no meaning given to
   this data by the system. You may supply the data through either the
   value or resource attribute; if both are given, then resource will be
   used.

   It is highly recommended that you avoid supplying related data as
   multiple separate meta-data entries. Instead, if you have complex data
   to associate with a component, then use the resource attribute to
   assign an XML resource that the client can parse to retrieve the
   complete data.

   Includes the following attributes:
   Attribute        Description
   android:name     A unique name for the given item.
   android:resource Resource identifier to assign to this piece of named
                    meta-data.
   android:value    Concrete value to assign to this piece of named
                    meta-data.

public static final int AndroidManifestPathPermission_pathPattern

   Since: API Level

   Specify a URI path that matches a simple pattern, as per PatternMatcher
   with PATTERN_SIMPLE_GLOB. Note that because '\' is used as an escape
   character when reading the string from XML (before it is parsed as a
   pattern), you will need to double-escape: for example a literal "*"

public static final int AndroidManifestPermission_protectionLevel

   Since: API Level

   Characterizes the potential risk implied in a permission and indicates
   the procedure the system should follow when determining whether to
   grant the permission to an application requesting it. Standard
   permissions have a predefined and permanent protectionLevel. If you are
   creating a custom permission in an application, you can define a
   protectionLevel attribute with one of the values listed below. If no
   protectionLevel is defined for a custom permission, the system assigns
   the default ("normal").

   Must be one of the following constant values.
   Constant Value Description
   normal 0 A lower-risk permission that gives an application access to
   isolated application-level features, with minimal risk to other
   applications, the system, or the user. The system automatically grants
   this type of permission to a requesting application at installation,
   without asking for the user's explicit approval (though the user always
   has the option to review these permissions before installing).
   dangerous 1 A higher-risk permission that would give a requesting
   application access to private user data or control over the device that
   can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission
   introduces potential risk, the system may not automatically grant it to
   the requesting application. For example, any dangerous permissions
   requested by an application may be displayed to the user and require
   confirmation before proceeding, or some other approach may be taken to
   avoid the user automatically allowing the use of such facilities.
   signature 2 A permission that the system is to grant only if the
   requesting application is signed with the same certificate as the
   application that declared the permission. If the certificates match,
   the system automatically grants the permission without notifying the
   user or asking for the user's explicit approval.
   signatureOrSystem 3 A permission that the system is to grant only to
   packages in the Android system image or that are signed with the same
   certificates. Please avoid using this option, as the signature
   protection level should be sufficient for most needs and works
   regardless of exactly where applications are installed. This permission
   is used for certain special situations where multiple vendors have
   applications built in to a system image which need to share specific
   features explicitly because they are being built together.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   protectionLevel.

public static final int AndroidManifestProvider_authorities

   Since: API Level

   Specify the authorities under which this content provider can be found.
   Multiple authorities may be supplied by separating them with a
   semicolon. Authority names should use a Java-style naming convention
   (such as com.google.provider.MyProvider) in order to avoid conflicts.
   Typically this name is the same as the class implementation describing
   the provider's data structure.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol authorities.
   Constant Value: 10 (0x0000000a)

public static final int AndroidManifestProvider_description

   Since: API Level

   Descriptive text for the associated data.

   Must be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol description.
   Constant Value: 14 (0x0000000e)

public static final int AndroidManifestProvider_enabled

   Since: API Level

   Specify whether this provider is enabled or not (that is, can be
   instantiated by the system). It can also be specified for an
   application as a whole, in which case a value of "false" will override
   any component specific values (a value of "true" will not override the
   component specific values).

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol enabled.
   Constant Value: 6 (0x00000006)

public static final int AndroidManifestProvider_exported

   Since: API Level

   Flag indicating whether the given application component is available to
   other applications. If false, it can only be accessed by applications
   with its same user id (which usually means only by code in its own
   package). If true, it can be invoked by external entities, though which
   ones can do so may be controlled through permissions. The default value
   is false for activity, receiver, and service components that do not
   specify any intent filters; it is true for activity, receiver, and
   service components that do have intent filters (implying they expect to
   be invoked by others who do not know their particular component name)
   and for all content providers.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol exported.
   Constant Value: 7 (0x00000007)

public static final int AndroidManifestProvider_grantUriPermissions

   Since: API Level

   If true, the Context.grantUriPermission or corresponding Intent flags
   can be used to allow others to access specific URIs in the content
   provider, even if they do not have an explicit read or write
   permission. If you are supporting this feature, you must be sure to
   call Context.revokeUriPermission when URIs are deleted from your
   provider.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   grantUriPermissions.
   Constant Value: 13 (0x0000000d)

public static final int AndroidManifestProvider_icon

   Since: API Level

   A Drawable resource providing a graphical representation of its
   associated item. Use with the application tag (to supply a default icon
   for all application components), or with the activity, receiver,
   service, or instrumentation tag (to supply a specific icon for that
   component). It may also be used with the intent-filter tag to supply an
   icon to show to the user when an activity is being selected based on a
   particular Intent.

   The given icon will be used to display to the user a graphical
   representation of its associated component; for example, as the icon
   for main activity that is displayed in the launcher. This must be a
   reference to a Drawable resource containing the image definition.

   Must be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol icon.
   Constant Value: 1 (0x00000001)

public static final int AndroidManifestProvider_initOrder

   Since: API Level

   Specify the order in which content providers hosted by a process are
   instantiated when that process is created. Not needed unless you have
   providers with dependencies between each other, to make sure that they
   are created in the order needed by those dependencies. The value is a
   simple integer, with higher numbers being initialized first.

   Must be an integer value, such as "100".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol initOrder.
   Constant Value: 12 (0x0000000c)

public static final int AndroidManifestProvider_label

   Since: API Level

   A user-legible name for the given item. Use with the application tag
   (to supply a default label for all application components), or with the
   activity, receiver, service, or instrumentation tag (to supply a
   specific label for that component). It may also be used with the
   intent-filter tag to supply a label to show to the user when an
   activity is being selected based on a particular Intent.

   The given label will be used wherever the user sees information about
   its associated component; for example, as the name of a main activity
   that is displayed in the launcher. You should generally set this to a
   reference to a string resource, so that it can be localized, however it
   is also allowed to supply a plain string for quick and dirty
   programming.

   May be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   May be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol label.
   Constant Value: 0 (0x00000000)

public static final int AndroidManifestProvider_multiprocess

   Since: API Level

   Specify whether a component is allowed to have multiple instances of
   itself running in different processes. Use with the activity and
   provider tags.

   Normally the system will ensure that all instances of a particular
   component are only running in a single process. You can use this
   attribute to disable that behavior, allowing the system to create
   instances wherever they are used (provided permissions allow it). This
   is most often used with content providers, so that instances of a
   provider can be created in each client process, allowing them to be
   used without performing IPC.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol multiprocess.
   Constant Value: 9 (0x00000009)

public static final int AndroidManifestProvider_name

   Since: API Level

   Required name of the class implementing the provider, deriving from
   ContentProvider. This is a fully qualified class name (for example,

   of the class is a period then it is appended to your package name.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol name.
   Constant Value: 2 (0x00000002)

public static final int AndroidManifestProvider_permission

   document for more information on permissions.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol permission.
   Constant Value: 3 (0x00000003)

public static final int AndroidManifestProvider_process

   Since: API Level

   Specify a specific process that the associated code is to run in. Use
   with the application tag (to supply a default process for all
   application components), or with the activity, receiver, service, or
   provider tag (to supply a specific icon for that component).

   Application components are normally run in a single process that is
   created for the entire application. You can use this tag to modify
   where they run. If the process name begins with a ':' character, a new
   process private to that application will be created when needed to run
   that component (allowing you to spread your application across multiple
   processes). If the process name begins with a lower-case character, the
   component will be run in a global process of that name, provided that
   you have permission to do so, allowing multiple applications to share
   one process to reduce resource usage.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol process.
   Constant Value: 8 (0x00000008)

   package). If true, it can be invoked by external entities, though which
   ones can do so may be controlled through permissions. The default value
   is false for activity, receiver, and service components that do not
   specify any intent filters; it is true for activity, receiver, and
   service components that do have intent filters (implying they expect to
   be invoked by others who do not know their particular component name)
   and for all content providers.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol exported.
   Constant Value: 5 (0x00000005)

public static final int AndroidManifestService_icon

   Since: API Level

   A Drawable resource providing a graphical representation of its
   associated item. Use with the application tag (to supply a default icon
   for all application components), or with the activity, receiver,
   service, or instrumentation tag (to supply a specific icon for that
   component). It may also be used with the intent-filter tag to supply an
   icon to show to the user when an activity is being selected based on a
   particular Intent.

   The given icon will be used to display to the user a graphical
   representation of its associated component; for example, as the icon
   for main activity that is displayed in the launcher. This must be a
   reference to a Drawable resource containing the image definition.

   Must be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol icon.
   Constant Value: 1 (0x00000001)

public static final int AndroidManifestService_label

   Since: API Level

   A user-legible name for the given item. Use with the application tag
   (to supply a default label for all application components), or with the
   activity, receiver, service, or instrumentation tag (to supply a
   specific label for that component). It may also be used with the
   intent-filter tag to supply a label to show to the user when an
   activity is being selected based on a particular Intent.

   The given label will be used wherever the user sees information about
   its associated component; for example, as the name of a main activity
   that is displayed in the launcher. You should generally set this to a
   reference to a string resource, so that it can be localized, however it
   is also allowed to supply a plain string for quick and dirty
   programming.

   May be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name".

   May be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol label.
   Constant Value: 0 (0x00000000)

public static final int AndroidManifestService_name

   Since: API Level

   Required name of the class implementing the service, deriving from
   Service. This is a fully qualified class name (for example,
   com.mycompany.myapp.MyService); as a short-hand if the first character
   of the class is a period then it is appended to your package name.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol name.
   Constant Value: 2 (0x00000002)

public static final int AndroidManifestService_permission

   Since: API Level

   Specify a permission that a client is required to have in order to use
   the associated object. If the client does not hold the named
   permission, its request will fail. See the Security and Permissions
   document for more information on permissions.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol permission.
   Constant Value: 3 (0x00000003)

public static final int AndroidManifestService_process

   Since: API Level

   Specify a specific process that the associated code is to run in. Use
   with the application tag (to supply a default process for all
   application components), or with the activity, receiver, service, or
   provider tag (to supply a specific icon for that component).

   Application components are normally run in a single process that is
   created for the entire application. You can use this tag to modify
   where they run. If the process name begins with a ':' character, a new
   process private to that application will be created when needed to run
   that component (allowing you to spread your application across multiple
   processes). If the process name begins with a lower-case character, the
   component will be run in a global process of that name, provided that
   you have permission to do so, allowing multiple applications to share
   one process to reduce resource usage.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol process.
   Constant Value: 6 (0x00000006)

public static final int[] AndroidManifestSupportsScreens

   Since: API Level

   The supports-screens specifies the screen dimensions an application
   supports. By default a modern application supports all screen sizes and
   must explicitly disable certain screen sizes here; older applications
   are assumed to only support the traditional normal (HVGA) screen size.
   Note that screen size is a separate axis from density, and is
   determined as the available pixels to an application after density
   scaling has been applied.

   This appears as a child tag of the manifest tag.

   Includes the following attributes:
   Attribute             Description
   android:anyDensity    Indicates whether the application can accommodate
                         any screen density.
   android:largeScreens  Indicates whether the application supports larger
                         screen form-factors.
   android:normalScreens Indicates whether an application supports the
                         normal screen form-factors.
   android:resizeable    Indicates whether the application can resize itself
                         to newer screen sizes.
   android:smallScreens  Indicates whether the application supports smaller
                         screen form-factors.

     * AndroidManifestSupportsScreens_normalScreens
     * AndroidManifestSupportsScreens_resizeable
     * AndroidManifestSupportsScreens_smallScreens

public static final int AndroidManifestSupportsScreens_anyDensity

   Since: API Level

   Indicates whether the application can accommodate any screen density.
   Older applications are assumed to not be able to, new ones able to. You
   can explicitly supply your abilities here.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol anyDensity.
   Constant Value: 0 (0x00000000)

public static final int AndroidManifestSupportsScreens_largeScreens

   Since: API Level

   Indicates whether the application supports larger screen form-factors.
   A large screen is defined as a screen that is significantly larger than
   a normal phone screen, and thus may require some special care on the
   application's part to make good use of it. An example would be a VGA
   normal density screen, though even larger screens are certainly
   possible. An application that does not support large screens will be
   placed as a postage stamp on such a screen, so that it retains the
   dimensions it was originally designed for.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol largeScreens.
   Constant Value: 3 (0x00000003)

public static final int AndroidManifestSupportsScreens_normalScreens

   Since: API Level

   Indicates whether an application supports the normal screen
   form-factors. Traditionally this is an HVGA normal density screen, but
   WQVGA low density and WVGA high density are also considered to be
   normal. This attribute is true by default, and applications currently
   should leave it that way.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol normalScreens.
   Constant Value: 2 (0x00000002)

public static final int AndroidManifestSupportsScreens_resizeable

   Since: API Level

   Indicates whether the application can resize itself to newer screen
   sizes. This is mostly used to distinguish between old applications that
   may not be compatible with newly introduced screen sizes and newer
   applications that should be; it will be set for you automatically based
   on whether you are targeting a newer platform that supports more
   screens.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol resizeable.
   Constant Value: 4 (0x00000004)

public static final int AndroidManifestSupportsScreens_smallScreens

   Since: API Level

   Indicates whether the application supports smaller screen form-factors.
   A small screen is defined as one with a smaller aspect ratio than the
   traditional HVGA screen; that is, for a portrait screen, less tall than
   an HVGA screen. In practice, this means a QVGA low density or VGA high
   density screen. An application that does not support small screens will
   not be available for small screen devices, since there is little the
   platform can do to make such an application work on a smaller screen.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol smallScreens.
   Constant Value: 1 (0x00000001)

public static final int[] AndroidManifestUsesConfiguration

   Since: API Level

   The uses-configuration tag specifies a specific hardware configuration
   value used by the application. For example an application might specify
   that it requires a physical keyboard or a particular navigation method
   like trackball. Multiple such attribute values can be specified by the
   application.

   This appears as a child tag of the root manifest tag.

   Includes the following attributes:
   Attribute               Description
   android:reqFiveWayNav   Application's requirement for five way navigation
   android:reqHardKeyboard Application's requirement for a hard keyboard

   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol reqFiveWayNav.
   Constant Value: 4 (0x00000004)

public static final int AndroidManifestUsesConfiguration_reqHardKeyboard

   Since: API Level

   Application's requirement for a hard keyboard

   Constant Value: 0 (0x00000000)

public static final int[] AndroidManifestUsesFeature

   Since: API Level

   The uses-feature tag specifies a specific feature used by the
   application. For example an application might specify that it requires
   specific version of OpenGL. Multiple such attribute values can be
   specified by the application.

   This appears as a child tag of the root manifest tag.

   Includes the following attributes:
   Attribute           Description
   android:glEsVersion The GLES driver version number needed by an
                       application.

     * AndroidManifestUsesFeature_required

public static final int AndroidManifestUsesFeature_glEsVersion

   Since: API Level

   The GLES driver version number needed by an application. The higher 16
   bits represent the major number and the lower 16 bits represent the
   minor number. For example for GL 1.2 referring to 0x00000102, the
   actual value should be set as 0x00010002.

   Must be an integer value, such as "100".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol glEsVersion.

   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol name.
   Constant Value: 0 (0x00000000)

public static final int AndroidManifestUsesFeature_required

   Since: API Level

   Specify whether this feature is required for the application. The
   default is true, meaning the application requires the feature, and does
   not want to be installed on devices that don't support it. If you set
   this to false, then this will not impose a restriction on where the
   application can be installed.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form

   Constant Value: 2 (0x00000002)

public static final int[] AndroidManifestUsesLibrary

   Since: API Level

   The uses-libraries specifies a shared library that this package
   requires to be linked against. Specifying this flag tells the system to
   include this library's code in your class loader.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol name.
   Constant Value: 0 (0x00000000)

public static final int AndroidManifestUsesLibrary_required

   Since: API Level

   Specify whether this library is required for the application. The
   default is true, meaning the application requires the library, and does
   not want to be installed on devices that don't support it. If you set
   this to false, then this will allow the application to be installed
   even if the library doesn't exist, and you will need to check for its
   presence dynamically at runtime.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol maxSdkVersion.
   Constant Value: 2 (0x00000002)

public static final int AndroidManifestUsesSdk_minSdkVersion

   Since: API Level

   This is the minimum SDK version number that the application requires.
   This number is an abstract integer, from the list in
   Build.VERSION_CODES If not supplied, the application will work on any

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol minSdkVersion.
   Constant Value: 0 (0x00000000)

public static final int AndroidManifestUsesSdk_targetSdkVersion

   Since: API Level

   This is the SDK version number that the application is targeting. It is
   able to run on older versions (down to minSdkVersion), but was
   explicitly tested to work with the version specified here. Specifying
   this version allows the platform to disable compatibility code that are
   not required or enable newer features that are not available to older
   applications. This may also be a string (such as "Donut") if this is
   built against a development branch, in which case minSdkVersion is also
   forced to be that string.

   May be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   May be an integer value, such as "100".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form

   internalOnly 1 Explicitly request to be installed on internal phone
   storage only.
   preferExternal 2 Prefer to be installed on SD card. There is no
   guarantee that the system will honor this request. The application
   might end up being installed on internal storage if external media is
   unavailable or too full.

   installLocation.
   Constant Value: 4 (0x00000004)

public static final int AndroidManifest_sharedUserId

   Since: API Level

   Specify the name of a user ID that will be shared between multiple
   packages. By default, each package gets its own unique user-id. By
   setting this value on two or more packages, each of these packages will
   be given a single shared user ID, so they can for example run in the
   same process. Note that for them to actually get the same user ID, they
   must also be signed with the same signature.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form

   sharedUserLabel.
   Constant Value: 3 (0x00000003)

public static final int AndroidManifest_versionCode

   Since: API Level

   Internal version code. This is the number used to determine whether one
   version is more recent than another: it has no other meaning than that
   higher numbers are more recent. You could use this number to encode a
   "x.y" in the lower and upper 16 bits, make it a build number, simply
   increase it by one each time a new version is released, or define it
   however else you want, as long as each successive version has a higher
   number. This is not a version number generally shown to the user, that
   is usually supplied with versionName.

   Must be an integer value, such as "100".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form

public static final int[] SearchableActionKey

   Since: API Level

   In order to process special action keys during search, you must define
   them using one or more "ActionKey" elements in your Searchable
   metadata. For a more in-depth discussion of action code handling,
   please refer to SearchManager.

   Includes the following attributes:
   Attribute Description
   android:keycode This attribute denotes the action key you wish to
   respond to.
   android:queryActionMsg If you wish to handle an action key during
   normal search query entry, you must define an action string here.
   android:suggestActionMsg If you wish to handle an action key while a
   suggestion is being displayed and selected, there are two ways to
   handle this.
   android:suggestActionMsgColumn If you wish to handle an action key
   while a suggestion is being displayed and selected, but you do not wish
   to enable this action key for every suggestion, then you can use this
   attribute to control it on a suggestion-by-suggestion basis.

   This attribute denotes the action key you wish to respond to. Note that
   not all action keys are actually supported using this mechanism, as
   many of them are used for typing, navigation, or system functions. This
   will be added to the ACTION_SEARCH intent that is passed to your
   searchable activity. To examine the key code, use
   getIntExtra(SearchManager.ACTION_KEY).

   Note, in addition to the keycode, you must also provide one or more of
   the action specifier attributes. Required attribute.

   Must be one of the following constant values.

public static final int SearchableActionKey_queryActionMsg

   Since: API Level

   If you wish to handle an action key during normal search query entry,
   you must define an action string here. This will be added to the
   ACTION_SEARCH intent that is passed to your searchable activity. To
   examine the string, use getStringExtra(SearchManager.ACTION_MSG).
   Optional attribute.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   queryActionMsg.
   Constant Value: 1 (0x00000001)

public static final int SearchableActionKey_suggestActionMsg

   Since: API Level

   If you wish to handle an action key while a suggestion is being
   displayed and selected, there are two ways to handle this. If all of
   your suggestions can handle the action key, you can simply define the
   action message using this attribute. This will be added to the
   ACTION_SEARCH intent that is passed to your searchable activity. To
   examine the string, use getStringExtra(SearchManager.ACTION_MSG).
   Optional attribute.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'

public static final int SearchableActionKey_suggestActionMsgColumn

   Since: API Level

   If you wish to handle an action key while a suggestion is being
   displayed and selected, but you do not wish to enable this action key
   for every suggestion, then you can use this attribute to control it on
   a suggestion-by-suggestion basis. First, you must define a column (and
   name it here) where your suggestions will include the action string.
   Then, in your content provider, you must provide this column, and when
   desired, provide data in this column. The search manager will look at
   your suggestion cursor, using the string provided here in order to
   select a column, and will use that to select a string from the cursor.
   That string will be added to the ACTION_SEARCH intent that is passed to
   your searchable activity. To examine the string, use
   getStringExtra(SearchManager.ACTION_MSG). If the data does not exist
   for the selection suggestion, the action key will be ignored.Optional
   attribute.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol

public static final int Searchable_autoUrlDetect

   Since: API Level

   If provided and true, URLs entered in the search dialog while searching
   within this activity would be detected and treated as URLs (show a 'go'
   button in the keyboard and invoke the browser directly when user
   launches the URL instead of passing the URL to the activity). If set to
   false any URLs entered are treated as normal query text. The default
   value is false. Optional attribute..

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol autoUrlDetect.

   If supplied, this string will be displayed as a hint to the user.
   Optional attribute.

   Must be a string value, using '\\;' to escape characters such as '\\n'
   or '\\uxxxx' for a unicode character.

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol hint.
   Constant Value: 2 (0x00000002)

public static final int Searchable_icon

   Since: API Level

   This is deprecated.
   The default application icon is now always used, so this attribute is
   obsolete.

   Must be a reference to another resource, in the form
   "@[+][package:]type:name" or to a theme attribute in the form

public static final int Searchable_imeOptions

   Since: API Level

   Additional features you can enable in an IME associated with an editor
   to improve the integration with your application. The constants here
   correspond to those defined by imeOptions.

   Must be one or more (separated by '|') of the following constant
   values.
   Constant Value Description
   normal 0x00000000 There are no special semantics associated with this
   editor.
   actionUnspecified 0x00000000 There is no specific action associated
   with this editor, let the editor come up with its own if it can.
   Corresponds to IME_NULL.
   actionNone 0x00000001 This editor has no action associated with it.
   Corresponds to IME_ACTION_NONE.
   actionGo 0x00000002 The action key performs a "go" operation to take
   the user to the target of the text they typed. Typically used, for
   example, when entering a URL. Corresponds to IME_ACTION_GO.
   actionSearch 0x00000003 The action key performs a "search" operation,
   taking the user to the results of searching for the text the have typed
   (in whatever context is appropriate). Corresponds to IME_ACTION_SEARCH.
   actionSend 0x00000004 The action key performs a "send" operation,
   delivering the text to its target. This is typically used when
   composing a message. Corresponds to IME_ACTION_SEND.
   actionNext 0x00000005 The action key performs a "next" operation,
   taking the user to the next field that will accept text. Corresponds to
   IME_ACTION_NEXT.
   actionDone 0x00000006 The action key performs a "done" operation,
   closing the soft input method. Corresponds to IME_ACTION_DONE.
   flagNoExtractUi 0x10000000 Used to specify that the IME does not need
   to show its extracted text UI. For input methods that may be
   fullscreen, often when in landscape mode, this allows them to be
   smaller and let part of the application be shown behind. Though there
   will likely be limited access to the application available from the
   user, it can make the experience of a (mostly) fullscreen IME less
   jarring. Note that when this flag is specified the IME may not be set
   up to be able to display text, so it should only be used in situations
   where this is not needed.

   Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NO_EXTRACT_UI.
   flagNoAccessoryAction 0x20000000 Used in conjunction with a custom
   action, this indicates that the action should not be available as an
   accessory button when the input method is full-screen. Note that by
   setting this flag, there can be cases where the action is simply never
   available to the user. Setting this generally means that you think
   showing text being edited is more important than the action you have
   supplied.

   Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NO_ACCESSORY_ACTION.
   flagNoEnterAction 0x40000000 Used in conjunction with a custom action,
   this indicates that the action should not be available in-line as a
   replacement for the "enter" key. Typically this is because the action
   has such a significant impact or is not recoverable enough that
   accidentally hitting it should be avoided, such as sending a message.
   Note that TextView will automatically set this flag for you on
   multi-line text views.

   Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NO_ENTER_ACTION.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol imeOptions.
   Constant Value: 16 (0x00000010)

   single value, though some can be combined together as indicated.
   Setting this attribute to anything besides none also implies that the
   text is editable.

   Must be one or more (separated by '|') of the following constant
   values.
   Constant Value Description
   none 0x00000000 There is no content type. The text is not editable.

   with this editor, let the editor come up with its own if it can.
   Corresponds to IME_NULL.
   actionNone 0x00000001 This editor has no action associated with it.
   Corresponds to IME_ACTION_NONE.
   actionGo 0x00000002 The action key performs a "go" operation to take
   the user to the target of the text they typed. Typically used, for
   example, when entering a URL. Corresponds to IME_ACTION_GO.
   actionSearch 0x00000003 The action key performs a "search" operation,
   taking the user to the results of searching for the text the have typed
   (in whatever context is appropriate). Corresponds to IME_ACTION_SEARCH.
   actionSend 0x00000004 The action key performs a "send" operation,
   delivering the text to its target. This is typically used when
   composing a message. Corresponds to IME_ACTION_SEND.
   actionNext 0x00000005 The action key performs a "next" operation,
   taking the user to the next field that will accept text. Corresponds to

   closing the soft input method. Corresponds to IME_ACTION_DONE.
   flagNoExtractUi 0x10000000 Used to specify that the IME does not need
   to show its extracted text UI. For input methods that may be
   fullscreen, often when in landscape mode, this allows them to be
   smaller and let part of the application be shown behind. Though there
   will likely be limited access to the application available from the
   user, it can make the experience of a (mostly) fullscreen IME less
   jarring. Note that when this flag is specified the IME may not be set
   up to be able to display text, so it should only be used in situations
   where this is not needed.

   Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NO_EXTRACT_UI.
   flagNoAccessoryAction 0x20000000 Used in conjunction with a custom
   action, this indicates that the action should not be available as an
   accessory button when the input method is full-screen. Note that by
   setting this flag, there can be cases where the action is simply never
   available to the user. Setting this generally means that you think
   showing text being edited is more important than the action you have
   supplied.

   Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NO_ACCESSORY_ACTION.
   flagNoEnterAction 0x40000000 Used in conjunction with a custom action,
   this indicates that the action should not be available in-line as a
   replacement for the "enter" key. Typically this is because the action
   has such a significant impact or is not recoverable enough that
   accidentally hitting it should be avoided, such as sending a message.
   Note that TextView will automatically set this flag for you on
   multi-line text views.

   Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NO_ENTER_ACTION.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol imeOptions.

   modes, depending on whether the content of the window has any layout
   views that can scroll their contents. If there is such a view, then the
   window will be resized, with the assumption being that the resizeable
   area can be reduced to make room for the input UI.
   adjustResize 0x10 Always resize the window: the content area of the
   window is reduced to make room for the soft input area.
   adjustPan 0x20 Don't resize the window to make room for the soft input
   area; instead pan the contents of the window as focus moves inside of
   it so that the user can see what they are typing. This is generally
   less desireable than panning because the user may need to close the
   input area to get at and interact with parts of the window.

   Drawable to use as the overall window background. There are a few
   special considerations you should use when settings this drawable:
     * This information will be used to infer the pixel format for your
       window's surface. If the drawable has any non-opaque pixels, your
       window will be translucent (32 bpp).
     * If you want to draw the entire background yourself, you should set
       this drawable to some solid color that closely matches that
       background (so the system's preview of your window will match), and
       then in code manually set your window's background to null so it

   it last was.
   stateHidden 2 Make the soft input area hidden when normally appropriate
   (when the user is navigating forward to your window).
   stateAlwaysHidden 3 Always make the soft input area hidden when this
   window has input focus.
   stateVisible 4 Make the soft input area visible when normally
   appropriate (when the user is navigating forward to your window).
   stateAlwaysVisible 5 Always make the soft input area visible when this
   window has input focus.
   adjustUnspecified 0x00 The window resize/pan adjustment has not been
   specified, the system will automatically select between resize and pan
   modes, depending on whether the content of the window has any layout
   views that can scroll their contents. If there is such a view, then the
   window will be resized, with the assumption being that the resizeable
   area can be reduced to make room for the input UI.
   adjustResize 0x10 Always resize the window: the content area of the
   window is reduced to make room for the soft input area.
   adjustPan 0x20 Don't resize the window to make room for the soft input
   area; instead pan the contents of the window as focus moves inside of
   it so that the user can see what they are typing. This is generally
   less desireable than panning because the user may need to close the
   input area to get at and interact with parts of the window.

   This corresponds to the global attribute resource symbol
   windowSoftInputMode.
   Constant Value: 13 (0x0000000d)
