   with an activity tag (to supply a specific setting for that component).

   Normally when an application is started, it is associated with the task
   of the activity that started it and stays there for its entire
   lifetime. You can use the allowTaskReparenting feature to force an
   activity to be re-parented to a different task when the task it is in
   goes to the background. Typically this is used to cause the activities
   of an application to move back to the main task associated with that
   application. The activity is re-parented to the task with the same
   taskAffinity as it has.

public static final int alwaysRetainTaskState

   Since: API Level 1

   Specify whether an acitivty's task state should always be maintained by
   the system, or if it is allowed to reset the task to its initial state
   in certain situations.

   Normally the system will reset a task (remove all activities from the
   stack and reset the root activity) in certain situations when the user
   re-selects that task from the home screen. Typically this will be done
   if the user hasn't visited that task for a certain amount of time, such
   as 30 minutes.

   By setting this attribute, the user will always return to your task in
   its last state, regardless of how they get there. This is useful, for

   state (such as multiple open tabs) that the application would not like
   to lose.

   now press home, and then return to activity A. Normally they would see
   activity B, since that is what they were last doing in A's task.
   However, if A has set this flag to true, then upon going to the
   background all of the tasks on top of it (B in this case) are removed,
   so when the user next returns to A they will restart at its original
   activity.

   When this option is used in conjunction with allowTaskReparenting, the
   allowTaskReparenting trumps the clear. That is, all activities above
   the root activity of the task will be removed: those that have an
   affinity will be moved to the task they are associated with, otherwise
   they will simply be dropped as described here.

   Additional features you can enable in an IME associated with an editor
   to improve the integration with your application. The constants here
   correspond to those defined by imeOptions.

   Must be one or more (separated by '|') of the following constant
   values.
   Constant Value Description
   normal 0x00000000 There are no special semantics associated with this
   editor.
   actionUnspecified 0x00000000 There is no specific action associated
   with this editor, let the editor come up with its own if it can.
   Corresponds to IME_NULL.
   actionNone 0x00000001 This editor has no action associated with it.
   Corresponds to IME_ACTION_NONE.
   actionGo 0x00000002 The action key performs a "go" operation to take
   the user to the target of the text they typed. Typically used, for
   example, when entering a URL. Corresponds to IME_ACTION_GO.
   actionSearch 0x00000003 The action key performs a "search" operation,
   taking the user to the results of searching for the text the have typed
   (in whatever context is appropriate). Corresponds to IME_ACTION_SEARCH.
   actionSend 0x00000004 The action key performs a "send" operation,
   delivering the text to its target. This is typically used when
   composing a message. Corresponds to IME_ACTION_SEND.
   actionNext 0x00000005 The action key performs a "next" operation,
   taking the user to the next field that will accept text. Corresponds to
   IME_ACTION_NEXT.
   actionDone 0x00000006 The action key performs a "done" operation,
   closing the soft input method. Corresponds to IME_ACTION_DONE.
   flagNoExtractUi 0x10000000 Used to specify that the IME does not need
   to show its extracted text UI. For input methods that may be
   fullscreen, often when in landscape mode, this allows them to be
   smaller and let part of the application be shown behind. Though there
   will likely be limited access to the application available from the
   user, it can make the experience of a (mostly) fullscreen IME less
   jarring. Note that when this flag is specified the IME may not be set
   up to be able to display text, so it should only be used in situations
   where this is not needed.

   Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NO_EXTRACT_UI.
   flagNoAccessoryAction 0x20000000 Used in conjunction with a custom
   action, this indicates that the action should not be available as an
   accessory button when the input method is full-screen. Note that by
   setting this flag, there can be cases where the action is simply never
   available to the user. Setting this generally means that you think
   showing text being edited is more important than the action you have
   supplied.

   Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NO_ACCESSORY_ACTION.
   flagNoEnterAction 0x40000000 Used in conjunction with a custom action,
   this indicates that the action should not be available in-line as a
   replacement for the "enter" key. Typically this is because the action
   has such a significant impact or is not recoverable enough that
   accidentally hitting it should be avoided, such as sending a message.
   Note that TextView will automatically set this flag for you on
   multi-line text views.

   Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NO_ENTER_ACTION.

   activity is being selected based on a particular Intent.

   The given label will be used wherever the user sees information about
   its associated component; for example, as the name of a main activity
   that is displayed in the launcher. You should generally set this to a
   reference to a string resource, so that it can be localized, however it
   is also allowed to supply a plain string for quick and dirty
   programming.

   May be a reference to another resource, in the form

public static final int largeScreens

   Since: API Level 4

   Indicates whether the application supports larger screen form-factors.
   A large screen is defined as a screen that is significantly larger than
   a normal phone screen, and thus may require some special care on the
   application's part to make good use of it. An example would be a VGA
   normal density screen, though even larger screens are certainly
   possible. An application that does not support large screens will be
   placed as a postage stamp on such a screen, so that it retains the
   dimensions it was originally designed for.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   This may also be a reference to a resource (in the form
   "@[package:]type:name") or theme attribute (in the form
   "?[package:][type:]name") containing a value of this type.
   Constant Value: 16843398 (0x01010286)

public static final int launchMode

   Since: API Level 1

   Specify how an activity should be launched. See the Application
   Fundamentals documentation for important information on how these
   options impact the behavior of your application.

   If this attribute is not specified, standard launch mode will be used.
   Note that the particular launch behavior can be changed in some ways at
   runtime through the Intent flags FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP,
   FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK, and FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK.

   Must be one of the following constant values.
   Constant Value Description
   standard 0 The default mode, which will usually create a new instance
   of the activity when it is started, though this behavior may change
   with the introduction of other options such as
   Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK.
   singleTop 1 If, when starting the activity, there is already an
   instance of the same activity class in the foreground that is
   interacting with the user, then re-use that instance. This existing
   instance will receive a call to Activity.onNewIntent() with the new
   Intent that is being started.
   singleTask 2 If, when starting the activity, there is already a task
   running that starts with this activity, then instead of starting a new
   instance the current task is brought to the front. The existing
   instance will receive a call to Activity.onNewIntent() with the new
   Intent that is being started, and with the
   Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_BROUGHT_TO_FRONT flag set. This is a superset of
   the singleTop mode, where if there is already an instance of the
   activity being started at the top of the stack, it will receive the
   Intent as described there (without the FLAG_ACTIVITY_BROUGHT_TO_FRONT
   flag set). See the Application Fundamentals documentation for more
   details on tasks.
   singleInstance 3 Only allow one instance of this activity to ever be
   running. This activity gets a unique task with only itself running in
   it; if it is ever launched again with the same Intent, then that task
   will be brought forward and its Activity.onNewIntent() method called.
   If this activity tries to start a new activity, that new activity will
   be launched in a separate task. See the Application Fundamentals
   documentation for more details on tasks.

   where they run. If the process name begins with a ':' character, a new
   process private to that application will be created when needed to run
   that component (allowing you to spread your application across multiple
   processes). If the process name begins with a lower-case character, the
   component will be run in a global process of that name, provided that
   you have permission to do so, allowing multiple applications to share
   one process to reduce resource usage.

   Constant Value: 16843131 (0x0101017b)

public static final int protectionLevel

   Since: API Level 1

   Characterizes the potential risk implied in a permission and indicates
   the procedure the system should follow when determining whether to
   grant the permission to an application requesting it. Standard
   permissions have a predefined and permanent protectionLevel. If you are
   creating a custom permission in an application, you can define a
   protectionLevel attribute with one of the values listed below. If no
   protectionLevel is defined for a custom permission, the system assigns
   the default ("normal").

   Must be one of the following constant values.
   Constant Value Description
   normal 0 A lower-risk permission that gives an application access to
   isolated application-level features, with minimal risk to other
   applications, the system, or the user. The system automatically grants
   this type of permission to a requesting application at installation,
   without asking for the user's explicit approval (though the user always
   has the option to review these permissions before installing).
   dangerous 1 A higher-risk permission that would give a requesting
   application access to private user data or control over the device that
   can negatively impact the user. Because this type of permission
   introduces potential risk, the system may not automatically grant it to
   the requesting application. For example, any dangerous permissions
   requested by an application may be displayed to the user and require
   confirmation before proceeding, or some other approach may be taken to
   avoid the user automatically allowing the use of such facilities.
   signature 2 A permission that the system is to grant only if the
   requesting application is signed with the same certificate as the
   application that declared the permission. If the certificates match,
   the system automatically grants the permission without notifying the
   user or asking for the user's explicit approval.
   signatureOrSystem 3 A permission that the system is to grant only to
   packages in the Android system image or that are signed with the same
   certificates. Please avoid using this option, as the signature
   protection level should be sufficient for most needs and works
   regardless of exactly where applications are installed. This permission
   is used for certain special situations where multiple vendors have
   applications built in to a system image which need to share specific
   features explicitly because they are being built together.
   Constant Value: 16842761 (0x01010009)

public static final int queryActionMsg

public static final int singleLine

   Since: API Level 1

   This constant is deprecated.

public static final int smallScreens

   Since: API Level 4

   Indicates whether the application supports smaller screen form-factors.
   A small screen is defined as one with a smaller aspect ratio than the

   an HVGA screen. In practice, this means a QVGA low density or VGA high
   density screen. An application that does not support small screens will
   not be available for small screen devices, since there is little the
   platform can do to make such an application work on a smaller screen.

   Must be a boolean value, either "true" or "false".

   adapter and the number of items visible on screen to determine the
   scrollbar's properties.

   Indicates that an Activity does not need to have its freeze state (as
   returned by onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) retained in order to be
   restarted. Generally you use this for activities that do not store any
   state. When this flag is set, if for some reason the activity is killed
   before it has a chance to save its state, then the system will not
   remove it from the activity stack like it normally would. Instead, the
   next time the user navigates to it its onCreate(Bundle) method will be
   called with a null icicle, just like it was starting for the first
   time.

   adjustUnspecified 0x00 The window resize/pan adjustment has not been
   specified, the system will automatically select between resize and pan
   modes, depending on whether the content of the window has any layout
   views that can scroll their contents. If there is such a view, then the
   window will be resized, with the assumption being that the resizeable
   area can be reduced to make room for the input UI.
   adjustResize 0x10 Always resize the window: the content area of the
   window is reduced to make room for the soft input area.
   adjustPan 0x20 Don't resize the window to make room for the soft input
   area; instead pan the contents of the window as focus moves inside of
   it so that the user can see what they are typing. This is generally
   less desireable than panning because the user may need to close the
   input area to get at and interact with parts of the window.
