////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** A well-designed user interface (UI) often has elements that don't require an explicit label to indicate their purpose to the user. A checkbox next to an item in a task list application has a fairly obvious purpose, as does a trash can in a file manager application. However, to your users with vision impairment, other UI cues are needed. Fortunately, it's easy to add labels to UI elements in your application that can be read out loud to your user by a speech-based accessibility service like TalkBack. 對視覺有障礙的人來說，content description 是用來取代 icon 或 lable 所要傳達的東西。
** you can add it via the XML layout, by setting a UI element's `android:contentDescription` attribute
** To edit the content description at runtime, use the `setContentDescription()` method
** This addition to your code is the simplest accessibility improvement you can make to your application, but one of the most useful.
** Try to add content descriptions wherever there's useful information, but avoid the web-developer pitfall of labelling everything with useless information. For instance, don't set an application icon's content description to "app icon". That just increases the noise a user needs to navigate in order to pull useful information from your interface.
** Try it out! Download TalkBack (an accessibility service published by Google) and enable it in Settings > Accessibility > TalkBack. Then navigate around your own application and listen for the audible cues provided by TalkBack. 不太會用，點一下是提示按到什麼東西，點兩下才是一般人的 tap??
