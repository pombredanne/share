= ditaa (DIagrams Through Ascii Art) =

太神奇了，有些圖形用手畫也畫不太出來！這讓圖形本身也可以做 revision control。

** ditaa is a small command-line utility written in Java, that can convert diagrams drawn using ascii art ('drawings' that contain characters that resemble lines like | / - ), into proper bitmap graphics. 真沒想到這會是用 Java 開發的
** ditaa interprets ascci art as a series of open and closed shapes, but it also uses special markup syntax to increase the possibilities of shapes and symbols that can be rendered. 有 open/closed shapes 之分
** there are several old FAQs with ascii diagrams lying out there. At this time and age ascii diagrams make my eyes hurt due to their ugliness. ditaa can be used to convert them to something nicer. Although ditaa would not be able to convert all of them (due to differences in drawing 'style' in each case), it could prove useful in the effort of modernising some of those documents without too much effort.
** Embedding diagrams to text-only formats. If ditaa was intergrated with those tools (and I'm planning to do the javadoc bit myself soon), then you would have readable/editable diagrams within the text format itself, something that would make things much easier. 如果搭配 AsciiDoc 這類 lightweight markup，不僅文件內容可以直接閱讀，連圖形也是。
** I also know a lot of people that can make an ascii diagram easily, but when it gets to using a diagram program, they don't do very well. Maybe this utility could help them make good-looking diagrams easily/quickly. 倒也不是畫不好，而是操作起來很不順手，而且不支援版控。
** In that sense ditaa is a diagram markup language, with very loose syntax.
** To start from the command line, type (where XXX is the version number): `java -jar ditaaXXX.jar`
** If you use / and \ to connect corners, they are rendered as round corners:
** Color codes can be used to add color to the diagrams. The syntax of color codes is `cXXX` where XXX is a hex number. (如果文字本身以 `c` 開頭怎麼辦??
** This can become a bit tedious after a while, so there are (only some for now) human readable color codes provided: 例如 `cRED`, `cGRE`, `cBLK`, `cBLU`, `cPNK`, `cYEL` 等
** As you can see above, if a colored shape contains any text, the color of the text is adjusted according to the underlying color. If the undelying color is dark, the text color is changed to white (from the default black).
** Note that color codes only apply if they are within closed shapes, and they have no effect anywhere outside.
** ditaa recognises some tags that change the way a rectangular shape is rendered. All tags are between `{` and `}`. 這真是一絕，可以把矩形扭轉成 `{d}` (document), `{s}` (storage), `{io}` (input/output)
** Any lines that contain either at least one `=` (for horizontal lines) or at least one `:` (for vertical lines) are rendered as dashed lines. Only one of those characters can make a whole line dashed, so this feature "spreads". The rationale behind that is that you only have to change one character to switch from normal to dashed (and vice versa), rather than redrawing the whole line/shape. Special symbols (like document or storage symbols) can also be dashed. 線條只要加上 `=` 或 `:` 就會變成虛線
** If `*` is encountered on a line (but not at the end of the line), it is rendered as a special marker, called the point marker 這是做什麼的? 可以畫 interface??
** If the pattern `' o XXXXX'` is encountered, where XXXXX is any text, the 'o' is interpreted and rendered as a bullet point. Note that there must be a space before the 'o' as well as after it. 這類說明，最好拉到圖形外面做

 * http://ditaa-addons.sourceforge.net/[ditaa addons] - 算是 ditaa 的應用，目前提供有 Textdiagram Javadoc taglet （在 Javadoc 內嵌圖形） 跟 "Ditaa Eps" （產生 EPS 向量圖）
 * link:../flowchart/asciiflow.html[Asciiflow - ASCII Flow Diagram Tool] - GUI 工具，畫完按 Ditaa! 就會把文字送到 ditta 官網產出圖形。不過只支援 ditta 部份的語法。
 * http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/ditaa.html[PlantUML] - 內部也有整合 ditaa？
