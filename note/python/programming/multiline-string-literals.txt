////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
*** The textwrap.dedent function allows one to start with correct indentation in the source, and then strip it from the text before use. The trade-off, as noted by some others, is that this is an extra function call on the literal; take this into account when deciding where to place these literals in your code.
*** The trailing \ in the log message literal is to ensure that line break isn't in the literal; that way, the literal doesn't start with a blank line, and instead starts with the next full line.
*** The return value from textwrap.dedent is the input string with all common leading whitespace indentation removed on each line of the string, meaning that the above log_message value will be flush left except for the further indented third line.
