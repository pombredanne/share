__The Python interpreter has a number of functions built into it that are always available.__ They are listed here in alphabetical order.

:::

'''`isinstance(object, classinfo)`'''

__Return true if the `object` argument is an instance of the `classinfo` argument, or of a (direct or indirect) subclass thereof. Also return true if `classinfo` is a ''type object'' (new-style class) and `object` is an object of that type or of a (direct or indirect) subclass thereof. If `object` is not a class instance or an object of the given type, the function always returns false. If `classinfo` is neither a ''class object'' nor a type object, it may be a tuple of class or type objects, or may recursively contain other such tuples (other sequence types are not accepted). If `classinfo` is not a class, type, or tuple of classes, types, and such tuples, a `TypeError` exception is raised.__

Changed in version 2.2: Support for a tuple of type information was added.

'''`issubclass(class, classinfo)`'''

__Return true if `class` is a subclass (direct or indirect) of `classinfo`. A class is considered a subclass of itself. `classinfo` may be a tuple of class objects, in which case every entry in `classinfo` will be checked. In any other case, a `TypeError` exception is raised.__

Changed in version 2.3: Support for a tuple of type information was added.

== 9.6. random — Generate pseudo-random numbers ==
http://docs.python.org/library/random.html @2010/07/26

This module implements ''pseudo-random number generators'' for various distributions.

:::

Functions for integers:

'''`random.randrange([start], stop[, step])`'''

__Return a randomly selected element from `range(start, stop, step)`.__ This is equivalent to `choice(range(start, stop, step))`, but doesn’t actually build a `range` object.

New in version 1.5.2.

'''`random.randint(a, b)`'''

Return a random integer `N` such that `a <= N <= b`.

Functions for sequences:

'''`random.choice(seq)`'''

Return a random element from the non-empty sequence `seq`. If `seq` is empty, raises `IndexError`.
