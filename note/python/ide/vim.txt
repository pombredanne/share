** The newer versions also include a 'vimdiff' mode that you can use to diff and merge file(s). Oh, I didn't mention it's also scriptable in Python
** Since version 6.0 it has folding. Folding makes your life easy when you have some long files.
** Vim 7.0 (released mid-2006) includes the Intellisense-like omni-completion for several languages. Here is the latest version of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1542[pythoncomplete].
** You can automatically enable syntax coloring and automatic indentation for Python code by adding the following lines to your `~/.vimrc` file: `syntax on` `filetype indent plugin on`
** A useful addition to Python source files is this comment: `# vim: tabstop=8 expandtab shiftwidth=4 softtabstop=4`
** This may need the modeline option enabled in your `~/.vimrc` file: set modeline(In Debian and Ubuntu, for example, the modeline option has been disabled for security reasons.)
** If you want to do this automatically for all files identified as Python, add the following to `~/.vim/ftplugin/python.vim`. Create the directory and/or file if it does not already exist.
** The first rule sets tab stops to eight characters wide. The second converts tabs to white space. The third makes the Tab key indent by four spaces. set shiftwidth sets the width for autoindents. Finally, the last rule allows auto-indenting depending on file type. With this method, tab settings do not need to be set in your python file and the `# vim: ...` line in the template below is not needed. 說真的，modeline 要在檔尾加東西，不是很妥當。
