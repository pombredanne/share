////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** ESX and ESXi do not support the cloning of VMs, only Virtual Center does, and this is by design. You can manually clone VMs using VI Client by creating folders in a datastore, copying .vmdk files to those folders, changing the name of the VM in the .vmx and .vmxf files, and associating the .vmdk files with new VMs.
** Cloning requires making a copy of a parent VM's files into a separate folder in a datastore, changing the name of the VM in the .vmx file, removing a few lines from the .vmx file causing a new UUID and MAC address to be auto-generated when the clone is first started, and registering the cloned VM in the ESXi inventory. You also need to make sure that the parent VM is not running or paused during the cloning operation.
