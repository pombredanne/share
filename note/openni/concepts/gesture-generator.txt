:title: [OpenNI] Gesture Generator

 * recognizes certain hand gestures and raise corresponding events accordingly.
 * gestures
   ** a gesture is a specific hand movement. The gesture generator node scans the FOV to detect gestures and generates the gesture data.
   ** gestures are identified by their names, e.g., "Wave" and "Click".
   ** active gestures = gestures trying to recognize in FOV, 一開始是空的
 * focus gesture
   ** 感覺 gesture generator 的定位跟 NITE gesture detectors 很不一樣，確實在還決定要追蹤哪一隻手之前，如何判斷更為細微的動作呢？
   ** an application might want to know who is the person they should interact with. For example, if currently there are three people in the room, which hand should be tracked?
   ** The application can use a specific gesture (such as waving to the camera) as a "focus gesture", meaning the person who performs this gesture will be the one interacting with the application.
   ** The application typically will then not want to recognize further gestures and so it must remove the gesture from the list; further gestures in the FOV may cause confusion. 如果沒有拿掉，表示隨時有人可以加進來...
 * recognized gestures
   ** an identification point (the position where the gesture was identified) + an end point (the position in which the hand currently is, when "gesture recognized" event is triggered)
   ** in most cases, both points will be the same. The application can then pass the end position to the hand generator for tracking that hand.
 * `org.OpenNI.GestureGenerator`
   ** `void addGesture(String gesture)` - add to active gestures
   ** `void addGesture(String gesture, BoundingBox3D area)` - the gesture will only be recognized if it is detected in that area.
   ** `void removeGesture(String gesture)` - remove from active gestures
   ** `int getNumberOfAvailableGestures()`
   ** `boolean isGestureAvailable(String gesture)`
   ** `boolean isGestureProgressSupported(String gesture)`
   ** `String[] enumerateAllGestures()` - available/supported gestures，為什麼只有 Wave, Click, RaiseHand, MovingHand 4 種？
   ** `String[] getAllActiveGestures()`
   ** events
      *** `IObservable<GestureRecognizedEventArgs> getGestureRecognizedEvent()`
      *** `IObservable<GestureProgressEventArgs> getGestureProgressEvent()`
      *** `IObservable<GesturePositionEventArgs> getGestureIntermediateStageCompletedEvent()`
      *** `IObservable<GesturePositionEventArgs> getGestureReadyForNextIntermediateStageEvent()`
      *** `IStateChangedObservable getGestureChangedEvent()`
 * `org.OpenNI.GestureRecognizedEventArgs` - `getIdPosition()`, `getEndPosition()`, `getGesture()`
 * 好像沒地方可以調整 gesture 的設定？一定得靠 session manager？
