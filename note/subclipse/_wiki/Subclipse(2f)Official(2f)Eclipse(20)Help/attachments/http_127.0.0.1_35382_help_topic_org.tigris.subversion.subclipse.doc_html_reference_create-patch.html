                                  Create Patch

   This command is initiated via the Team > Create Patch ... menu option.

Overview

   This command lets you create a Patch in unified diff format.

Process

   [create-patch.png]

   The content of the patch is determined by the scope of the resources
   selected with the Team > Create Patch... option. The output of the
   Patch operation can be directed to either the clipboard, file system or
   saved in a workspace project. Clicking Next will allow you to choose
   whether the Patch processing should recurse through subdirectories
   within your selection.

   Be aware that changes to binary files are never shown in the patch.
   Also, in order to have new files included in the patch, you must first
   take the Team > Add to Version Control option.

   For a more detailed discussion on this topic, take a look at the CVS
   documentation: Working with patches.
