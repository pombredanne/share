=== Create Patch ===
http://127.0.0.1:35382/help/topic/org.tigris.subversion.subclipse.doc/html/reference/create-patch.html @2009/11/03

This command is initiated via the Team > Create Patch ...  menu option.

'''Overview'''

This command lets you create a Patch in ''unified diff'' format. [A standard representation for the differences between two files where removed lines are prefaced with a - and added lines are prefaced with a +.]

'''Process'''

The content of the patch is determined by the scope of the resources selected with the Team > Create Patch... option. __The output of the Patch operation can be directed to either the clipboard, file system or saved in a workspace project.__ Clicking Next will allow you to choose whether the Patch processing should recurse through subdirectories within your selection.

__Be aware that changes to binary files are never shown in the patch. (實驗確認 `svn diff` 也有相同的限制) Also, in order to have new files included in the patch, you must first take the Team > Add to Version Control option. (但不一定要送交)__

Select the local file or folder resource to update with the Patch and indentify the incoming source of the Patch operation. If the Patch is in a file, type the name and path of the Patch file or click Browse to select the file from a local or networked folder location. Alternatively, if the Patch is on the clipboard, check the Clipboard option.
