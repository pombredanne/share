     __________________________________________________________________

General questions:

Why does this project exist?

   Subclipse exists to provide an outstanding user interface to Subversion
   from within the Eclipse IDE. We aim to provide a client that is every
   bit as robust and user-friendly as the CVS client that comes with
   Eclipse. That being said, there are a lot of major technical
   differences between Subversion and CVS. Therefore, we try to strike a
   balance between providing a UI that will be familiar to experienced
   Eclipse CVS users, and one that is appropriate for the Subversion
   action being exposed. In particular, the way that Subversion handles
   branches and tags is very, very different from CVS. Consequently the UI
   for these features in Subclipse is different than the UI for the CVS
   client.

Does Subclipse support Eclipse X.Y or Other IDE X.Y?

   Subclipse should support any IDE or application that is built on the
   Eclipse framework. The Subclipse feature has the appropriate <requires>
   tags to define the Eclipse features that we require. The current
   version of Subclipse supports Eclipse 3.x. There is an older version of
   Subclipse that supports Eclipse 2.x and applications that are based on
   it, such as WebSphere Studio 5.x. That version of Subclipse is no
   longer supported or actively developed.

What is an adapter? What is JavaHL?

   Unlike CVS, which does not have an official API, Subversion was
   designed from the start to be an API. Subversion is written (in C) as a
   set of libraries. Subversion then provides a default UI, in the form of
   a command line interface, that uses these libraries. Subversion also
   provides language bindings for various programing languages so that
   these same libraries can be used in your language of choice. JavaHL is
   the name of the Java language binding provided by the Subversion
   project. JavaHL is an official part of the Subversion project, not the
   Subclipse project.

   svnClientAdapter is a Java project that was developed for Subclipse. It
   provides an even higher level of abstraction to the Subversion
   libraries. It also allows for different ways of accessing Subversion
   functionality. Historically, the two options were to use the JavaHL
   library or the Subversion command line. Eventually, a third option was
   added and that is to use the SVNKit library which is a 100% Pure Java
   implementation of the protocols used by Subversion. This option has the
   advantage of not requiring any native libraries installed on the
   client. Of course, since SVNKit does not utilize the Subversion
   libraries it does not have the guaranteed compatibility that you can
   expect from JavaHL or the command line adapters. That being said,
   SVNKit is tested against the same test suite that tests the Subversion
   command line, and passes those tests.

Which adapter should I use?

   If the JavaHL library is available on your system, or easily
   attainable, then it is probably the best choice. That being said,
   SVNKit is a great option.

Which adapter am I using?

   You can see which adapter you are using in your Eclipse preferences. Go
   to Team > SVN. In the latest versions of Subclipse the client adapter
   is a drop-down. The drop-down shows any adapters you have installed. If
   the adapter loads properly, the version is shown, otherwise it reports
   "Not available".

   If you have chosen the JavaHL adapter and it is not available,
   Subclipse will fall back to using SVNKit if it is installed and
   available.

I have chosen SVNKit, but it looks like JavaHL is still being used.

   If your preferences show that you are using SVNKit, then that is what
   is being used. SVNKit provides a pure Java implementation of the JavaHL
   Java interface and that is how Subclipse uses it. So the JavaHL Java
   namespace still shows up in things like errors/exceptions because that
   namespace is part of the interface.

Usernames and passwords

   Subclipse does not collect or store username and password credentials
   when defining a repository. This is because the JavaHL and SVNKit
   client adapters are intelligent enough to prompt you for this
   information when they need to -- including when your password has
   changed.

   You can also allow the adapter to cache this information and a common
   question is how do you delete this cached information so that you can
   be prompted again? We have an open request to have an API added to
   JavaHL so that we could provide a UI to do this. Currently, you have to
   manually delete the cache. The location of the cache varies based on
   the client adapter used.

   JavaHL caches the information in the same location as the command line
   client -- in the Subversion runtime configuration area. On Windows this
   is located in %APPDATA%\Subversion\auth. On Linux and OSX it is located
   in ~/.subversion/auth. Just find and delete the file with the cached
   information.

   SVNKit caches information in the Eclipse keyring. By default this is a
   file named .keyring that is stored in the root of the Eclipse
   configuration folder. Both of these values can be overriden with
   command line options. To clear the cache, you have to delete the file.
   Eclipse will create a new empty keyring when you restart.

How-to:

How do I check out the Subclipse code?

   The URL for the Subclipse repository is
   http://subclipse.tigris.org/svn/subclipse/. If you have at least the
   Observer role in the Subclipse project, then provide your tigris.org
   username and password when prompted. Otherwise use a value of "guest"
   for username and leave the password field empty. Subclipse development
   is currently active on trunk.

   Also see: SubclipseDevelopment

How do I create a repository? How do I import data into it?

   Subclipse provides an option for creating a repository but this is
   really only suited for personal development where you do not need to
   share your code. Typically you would setup a Subversion server, create
   the repository on the server and then point Subclipse at the server.
   Defining a connection is one of the first things you should do when
   using Subclipse. This is done from the Subclipse Repository Exploring
   perspective.

   As for importing data, there are numerous ways it can be done,
   including doing it from outside of Eclipse. Assuming you have an
   existing project in your Eclipse workspace that you want to add to your
   repository, you need to right-click on the project and do Team -> Share
   Project. Then follow the wizard.

How do I configure an HTTP proxy connection?

   If you are using the JavaHL or command-line client adapter then all
   communication with your repository is performed by the Subversion
   libraries. Consequently, the configuration is the same as what you
   would do for the Subversion command line. See:
   http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.confarea.html#svn.advan
   ced.confarea.opts for more information.

   If you are using the SVNKit adapter then see:
   http://svnkit.com/kb/config-settings.html for more information.

   Also see: Support for SVN Protocols for more details.

How do I specify SSL client certificates?

   You should be prompted when/if you need to supply the server with a
   client certificate, just as you are when using the command-line. You
   may want to configure Subversion so that it already knows about the
   location of your client certificate. See:
   http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.serverconfig.httpd.html#svn.serv
   erconfig.httpd.authn.sslcerts for more information.

   Also see: Support for SVN Protocols for more details.

How do I configure an svn+ssh:// connection?

   If you are using the JavaHL then all communication with your repository
   is performed by the Subversion libraries. Consequently, the
   configuration is the same as what you would do for the Subversion
   command line. See:
   http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.confarea.html#svn.advan
   ced.confarea.opts for more information. For Windows users, here is a
   great explanation of how to set this up from our mailing list archives:
   Configuring svn+ssh:// on Windows.

   Note: By default Eclipse is set to JavaHL. Goto
   Eclipse->Window->Preferences->Team->SVN and change the SVN Interface to
   SVNKit.
   If you are using the SVNKit client adapter you should be dynamically
   prompted for your SSH username, password, keyfile, port etc... When
   defining the repository connection in Subclipse, simply specify the URL
   like svn+ssh://hostname/repos. Do not include your username in the URL
   and do not provide a username and password in the connection dialog. At
   runtime, SVNKit will prompt you for your SSH credentials and optionally
   cache them in the Eclipse keyring. If you are not prompted for your
   credentials, it may be because you have previously attempted to
   manually configure SVNKit. If so, then you should "undo" all of that
   manual configuration. The older manual configuration is documented at:
   http://svnkit.com/kb/config-settings.html.

   If you do prefer JavaHL on Windows, try these steps to set up svn+ssh
   access without password:
    1. Install the complete PuTTY:
       http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty-0.60-installer
       .exe
    2. Verify: Run PuTTY to connect to your remote host through ssh.
    3. Run PuTTYget to generate a private/public key pair.
    4. Copy the public key into your remote $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
       file.
    5. Verify: Run PuTTY to get a remote commandline without entering
       password.
    6. Verify on commandline, e.g.
       Plink.exe -2 -i D:\home\.ssh\id_dsa.ppk your.remote.host -l yourUse
       r
    7. Install http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ -- this includes a Plink
       client without console link
    8. Verify: Connect your svn+ssh repository in TortoiseSVN. Will ask
       for password!
    9. Edit C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application
       Data\Subversion\config and add this:
[tunnels]
ssh=C:\\PROGRA~1\\TortoiseSVN\\bin\\TortoisePlink.exe -2 -i D:\\home\\.ssh\\id_d
sa.ppk
   10. Verify: TortoiseSVN should work without password now
   11. Verify: Subclipse + JavaHL should also work without password now.

Troubleshooting:

While installing Subclipse I can't get past the Review Licenses page

   This is a bug in the Galileo p2 feature. Try moving back and forth in
   the wizard, or closing and re-opening the wizard. You might find other
   suggestions in the comments in the Eclipse Bugzilla page
     * https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=277265

New files added by other users are not showing up in Synchronize view or even
coming into my workspace when I update the entire project

   This is caused by a bug in Subversion 1.6 that was fixed in Subversion
   1.6.2. However, the fix just prevents the problem from continuing to
   happen, it does not fix your existing working copies. To fix your
   working copy follow these steps:
    1. Right-click on your Project and choose Team > Update to Version ...
    2. Change the Depth combo box to a value of "Fully recursive"
    3. Check the box that says "Change working copy to specified depth"
    4. Press OK

   The bug was that when new folders were added to Subversion in your
   working copy, they were added with a depth option of empty. So you
   could see updates to anything you added, but new files and folders
   added by others would not show up due to the depth setting. The
   Subversion add API was fixed to set the depth to fully recursive as had
   always been the case.

How do I get the JavaHL library for my operating system?

   There is a dedicated Wiki page with detailed JavaHL Information.

How do I build JavaHL from source?

   JavaHL is part of the Subversion project. So to begin, you probably
   want to download the latest source tarball. See:
   http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html. You should refer to the
   Subversion instructions for detailed information, but on a *nix system
   the general procedure is this:
./configure --your-other-flags=here --enable-javahl --with-jdk=$JAVA_HOME
make
make javahl
sudo make install install-javahl

   The main part to check before running the above command is
   "--your-other-flags". Here is a personal example from an OSX system:
./configure \
    --prefix=/opt/svn-1.5 \
    --enable-maintainer-mode \
    --enable-javahl \
    --disable-mod-activation \
    --with-swig=/opt/local/bin/swig \
    --with-apr=/opt/local/bin/apr-1-config \
    --with-apr-util=/opt/local/bin/apu-1-config \
    --with-apxs=/opt/local/apache2/bin/apxs \
    --with-neon=/opt/local \
    --with-serf=/opt/local \
    --with-berkeley-db=/opt/local \
    --with-junit=/opt/local/share/java/junit.jar

I think I have a valid JavaHL library installed, but Subclipse says it is
"Not available". What should I do?

   A wiki page has been created with detailed JavaHL Information.

I keep getting an error message about my "Working Copy not locked". Is this a
bug? What should I do?

   You are performing an operation like Update and it fails with an error
   that look something like this:
 update -r HEAD C:/workspace/project/bin
    Working copy not locked; this is probably a bug, please report
 svn: Working copy 'C:\workspace\project\bin' is missing or not locked

   This message is coming straight out of the Subversion library, so
   technically it is Subversion asking you to report the problem to them.
   This error message is kind of their general error message when
   something really unexpected happens. In the case of Eclipse, the
   problem is almost always one specific thing. The problem is that your
   Eclipse build folder was versioned and added to your repository. What
   happens is that when Eclipse does a full build it will delete
   everything in this folder, including the ".svn" metadata folder. When
   Subversion cannot find this folder it issues the above error.

   The solution is to delete this folder from your repository, which you
   can do from the SVN Repositories view. Then try deleting the folder
   from your working copy and performing an update. You might need to
   checkout your project again. Once you have a valid project again, be
   sure to add the build folder to the svn:ignore property of its parent
   folder so that the problem does not happen again.

   If this is not your problem, then as best as you can try to figure out
   what might have led up to having this problem and report it on the
   Subversion users@subversion.tigris.org mailing list.

I am trying to commit some changes and I am getting an error message about
the transaction being "out of date". What does this mean and what should I
do?

   Whenever you see "out of date" in an error message it means that the
   revision of the item in the repository is newer than the copy in your
   local working copy. The solution is always going to be to run an
   update, so that your working copy is up to date with the repository,
   and then do the commit again (assuming that the update did not generate
   any conflicts). For files, this is usually pretty easy to understand
   how and why this happens. However, Subversion also versions folders,
   and it is usually with folders that this problem most often happens.
   Subversion does not allow you to delete/rename a folder OR change its
   versioned properties, UNLESS the local copy of the folder is at the
   HEAD revision of the folder in the repository.

   Your next question might be: "OK, I can maybe understand that, but why
   is my folder out of date? I am the only person working in this
   repository." That is a valid question, the answer lies in the way that
   Subversion works. When you commit a change to a file, the revision of
   the file in your working copy is updated to that new revision when the
   commit completes, however the version of the parent folder(s) of that
   file is not updated. This is because there may have been adds/deletes
   to other files in that folder and until you have run an update, the
   folder is not really at that new revision. This is called "mixed
   revision working copies" and is probably explained better in the
   Subversion book.

   In summary, the answer is always to do an update so that the folder or
   file is updated to its HEAD revision.

On the SVN preferences page the SVN Interface drop down is Blank. What do I
do?

   This issue normally means you did not install an adapter. Because if
   you did, then they should show up in the drop-down and in worst case
   with a "Not available" next to them. For the drop-down to be empty
   means the features are either not installed or not loading.

   So here is what you need from an Eclipse "feature" perspective:

   Must have
     * Subclipse
     * SVN Client Adapter

   Must have at least one of
     * JavaHL Adapter
     * SVNKit Adapter

   If SVNKit Adapter is to be used, must have
     * SVNKit Library

   The most common reason for to see this issue is that one of the Must
   have at lease one of is not loaded or it is failing to load for some
   reason.

Obsolete FAQs:

   The following FAQs are no longer valid if using a recent version of
   Subclipse, Subversion or Eclipse. They are preserved here for users of
   these older versions.

As soon as I do something with Subclipse on Windows, Eclipse just crashes.
Why does this happen?

   This is a fairly recent problem that is caused by a DLL
   incompatibility. Subversion uses a library called APR or the Apache
   Portable Runtime. This library has a component called APR-ICONV which
   is used for translating characters in path and file names to/from UTF8
   and the local character set. The release of Apache 2.2 brought with it
   new releases of APR and APR-ICONV and these are not binary compatible
   with previous releases. Subclipse ships with the Apache 2.0 version of
   these libraries. This crash occurs if you install an application that
   installs the Apache 2.2 version of these libraries AND ALSO sets the
   APR_ICONV_PATH environment variable to a path that contains the Apache
   2.2 version of the APR-ICONV .so objects.

   The fix is actually simple. Change the name of the environment variable
   to APR_ICONV1_PATH. The Apache 2.2 library will look for this
   environment variable name first, and only fallback to the older name if
   it is not found. You can safely have an APR_ICONV_PATH environment
   variable pointing to the Apache 2.0 version of these libraries and the
   APR_ICONV1_PATH environment variable pointing to the Apache 2.2
   version.

   Subversion 1.5 has resolved this problem by discontinuing the use of
   APR-ICONV. Instead, Subversion will use translation routines that are
   provided by the Windows operating system.

Why am I getting an error dialog telling me the case of my Eclipse workspace
path does not match the filesystem? Windows does not seem to care.

   The underlying problem here is in Eclipse, see Bug#: 95832. Eclipse
   does not canonicalize the workspace path to match the case of the
   underlying OS. That alone would not be a problem, but Eclipse also has
   code which relies on an exact string match when converting a path
   represented as a String to an Eclipse resource. When Subclipse calls
   Subversion API's, Subversion naturally passes back paths in their exact
   case from the file system. Subclipse then has to take those Strings and
   convert them to an Eclipse IResource. The Eclipse code to do this fails
   if the case of the string does not match exactly with the value that
   Eclipse has stored for the workspace.

   This problem was causing a lot of problems for Subclipse users and it
   took a long time before the underlying cause was discovered. See
   Subclipse issue# 285 and all of the duplicates. Since we cannot fix the
   Eclipse problem and this problem is so hard for a user to
   self-diagnose, we added in our own check which displays a warning
   dialog when we detect this situation exists. The validation code looks
   like this:
   1  public static boolean validateWorkspacePath() {
   2     File file = ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot().getLocation().toFi
le();
   3     String canonicalPath = null;
   4     try {
   5        canonicalPath = file.getCanonicalPath();
   6     } catch (IOException e) {
   7         e.printStackTrace();
   8     }
   9     if (!file.getAbsolutePath().equals(canonicalPath)) {
  10         MessageDialog.openError(Display.getCurrent().getActiveShell(), Poli
cy.bind("WorkspacePathValidator.title"),
  11          Policy.bind("WorkspacePathValidator.eclipsePath") + "\n\n"  + file
.getAbsolutePath() +
  12          "\n\n" + Policy.bind("WorkspacePathValidator.fileSystemPath") + "\
n\n" + canonicalPath +
  13          "\n\n" + Policy.bind("WorkspacePathValidator.instructions"));
  14         return false;
  15     }
  16     return true;
  17  }

   NOTE: We recently discovered that this basic issue was causing another
   problem users were seeing. In this case it happens when you use File ->
   Import to import a project and you do not specify the correct case when
   importing. This leads to the same null resource problem. In this
   scenario, we are now logging a very detailed error in the SVN Console
   and Eclipse error log. It also points to this FAQ. In recreating the
   problem it appeared that the SVNKit adapter did not have the problem.
   Possibly because it is using the same Java API's as Eclipse the case
   does not get canonicalized as it does when using the JavaHL native C
   libraries. Other than switching to SVNKit, the way to solve the problem
   in this scenario would be to delete the project from the workspace and
   re-import it. Use the Eclipse file chooser to select the project so
   that the case matches the OS.

   Update: The underlying problem has been fixed in Eclipse 3.2, and if
   you install the version of Subclipse for Eclipse 3.2 or higher, we no
   longer issue these warnings.
