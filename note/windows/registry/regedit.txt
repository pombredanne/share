////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** In fact, in Windows XP it warns, “Although you can use Registry Editor to inspect and modify the registry, doing so is not recommended, as making incorrect changes can damage your system.” Pretty offputting but the caution is overdone. In Windows Vista/7, Microsoft relaxed a bit and included a few more details in Help but still not enough to let anyone understand how to use Regedit.
** Make only one Registry edit at a time. Wait to see if everything works the way you want before making any more changes to the Registry.
** Regedit is a two-pane interface with keys in the left pane (key pane) and value names with the corresponding data in the right pane (value pane).
** The bottom of the window for Regedit shows the path of the currently highlighted key
** Another two very useful functions are "Find..." and "Find Next". The Registry has thousands of keys and these search functions are very necessary. Unfortunately, the search function cannot find binary values or REG_DWORD entries. It searches key names, value names, and string data.
** The Edit menu also contains a useful entry "Copy Key Name" that sends the path of the key to the clipboard, Since path names can be quite long, this can be very useful.
** Another menu that can be quite useful is "Favorites". If you find that there are is a certain key that you modify often, this key can be added to the "Favorites' list for easy access.
** Notice that I use the word "merge". REG files do not replace keys but add to them, something to keep in mind. Anything extra that you may have added is not deleted. Some experienced PC users prefer to do any actual editing in the exported REG file and then to merge the edited file. This prevents accidentally doing something to the wrong key. 要達到 replace 的效果只能先把 key 給刪了再做 merge。
