Installing Fonts on Linux

   One of the things I always enjoy when creating presentations, letters,
   videos, graphics and other documents is playing with different fonts.
   Fonts can change a boring text-only presentation or paper into an
   exciting, stylish, wild or classic experience. Yes, it is very easy to
   get carried away, but that is part of the fun -- trying to achieve the
   perfect balance between form and function.

   During my computer-using years, I have collected quite a few fonts.
   Some were included with clip-art packages I purchased over the years,
   some came pre-installed on computers I used to own, others were
   downloaded from Web sites and so on.

   You might have a similar collection of fonts. Or, maybe you have only a
   few that you really, really like. Thankfully, Linux has no problem with
   your Windows TrueType and OpenType fonts, and installing them is
   simple.

   If you are downloading fonts from a site on the Internet, they probably
   come in a zip archive. Many Web sites have fonts freely available for
   download and offer both Windows and Macintosh versions; be sure to
   download the Windows version.

   [9154f1.png]
   Figure 1. A Typical Font Archive

   The easiest way to open up a zip archive is to click on it. If you use
   KDE, the file will open in the Ark archive manager. There might be
   several files listed in the archive; we are interested only in the ones
   with the .ttf or .otf extensions -- for TrueType and OpenType fonts,
   respectively. Click on the font file to preview it.

   [9154f2.png]
   Figure 2. Click on the font file to open it in the Font Viewer program.

   When you open a font inside a zip archive, Ark will complain and ask if
   you want to view the file with an external program. Click on the View
   Externally button to view the font. If your fonts are not in a zip
   archive, simply click on them to open them in the Font Viewer.

   [9154f3.png]
   Figure 3. Ark can't view fonts directly, so it will ask if you want to
   view the font using an external program.

   The Font Viewer displays your font in several different sizes, so you
   can get a good idea of what it will look like. To install the font,
   click the Install button in the lower-right corner. If you can't see
   the install button, resize the window and it will appear.

   [9154f4.png]
   Figure 4. The Font Viewer program lets you see what your font will look
   like in different sizes and has a handy install button.

   After clicking the Install button, the Font Viewer asks where you want
   the font installed. Choose the Personal option if you just want the
   font installed for you as a user only. Choose the System option if you
   want all users on your computer to have access to the font. In order to
   install the font using the System option, you need to be the
   Administrator on your computer. On my home system, there is only one
   login that everyone uses, so for me either choice works equally as
   well.

   [9154f5.png]
   Figure 5. You can choose where to install your fonts.

   After installing the font, the Font Viewer lets you know it was
   successfully installed. That's all there is to it -- really. Your font
   is now installed and ready to use. It's easy.

   [9154f6.png]
   Figure 6. Success -- your font is now installed.

   This process works well for the occasional font install, but installing
   fonts one at a time like this can become tedious in a hurry --
   especially if you have a lot of fonts like I do. A quicker way is
   simply to put all your fonts into the correct location at the same
   time.

   If the fonts are in zip archives, the first step is to get them out of
   there using Ark. When I was installing all of my fonts, I first
   collected them all into a folder I created on my Desktop called
   my_fonts. Once all of your fonts are unpacked and ready to install, the
   big question is, where do they go?

   The answer is, it depends. There are two places you can put fonts. This
   goes back to the question that the Font Viewer application asks when it
   is installing fonts. Where you put them depends on whether you want
   only your login to be able to see and use the fonts or whether you want
   everyone on the system to be able to see and use the fonts.

   If you want only your login to see them, put them into a folder in your
   home directory called .fonts. You probably have never seen this folder
   -- that is because of the dot (the .) at the beginning of its name.
   This makes a file or folder invisible on Linux.

   To see this folder, and all other invisible files and folders in your
   home directory, go to the System menu and choose Home Folder. After
   that window opens, go to the View menu and click Show Hidden Files. The
   first time I did this, I was surprised by how many files there actually
   were in my supposedly empty home folder.

   [9154f7.png]
   Figure 7. Click on Show Hidden Files to view everything in your home
   directory.

   If the .fonts folder exists, you should now be able to see it. If you
   still cannot see it, you can create it. To create the folder, go to the
   Edit menu and choose Create New..., and then Folder. Be sure to name it
   .fonts, and then click the OK button.

   Open the .fonts folder, and drag and drop your fonts into it. After
   they are copied over, KDE generates nice thumbnails so you can identify
   the fonts easily. When you next launch your word processor or other
   program, your newly installed fonts will be waiting for you.
   [9154f8.png]
   Figure 8. KDE's thumbnails let you see what your fonts look like at a
   glance.

   If you want to install the fonts for everyone, the folder you should
   put them is /usr/local/share/fonts/. You can get there by clicking on
   the System menu and then your hard drive. There you will see a bunch of
   folders with names like tmp, var and usr. Open the usr folder, then
   local, then share and finally, the fonts folder. However, when you then
   try to put your fonts there, the window probably will report that you
   don't have permission to write to the folder.

   To grant your self the permission to put items into the
   /usr/local/share/fonts/ folder, you need to be part of the staff group.
   To add yourself to this group, you need to be the Administrator on your
   computer or get the Administrator to do it for you.

   [9154f9.png]
   Figure 9. Adding yourself to the staff group will give you write access
   to the /usr/local/share/fonts/ folder.

   Go to the K menu, and choose System Settings. Then, in the System
   Administration section, choose Users & Groups. In that window, in the
   bottom right is a button called Administrator Mode...; click it and
   enter your password. If successful, the window now will have a red
   outline, which is KDE's way of telling you that you are in
   administrator mode.

   Now, select your login name and click the Modify... button, and the
   User Account window opens. Now click the Select... button on the
   Secondary Groups: line. In the Available Groups column, scroll down and
   highlight staff, and then click the Add button. Click OK in that
   window, the OK button on the User Account window and lastly the Close
   button on the Users & Groups window, and you are almost done.

   Log out and then log back in to activate the new settings. Now when you
   navigate to the folder, you will be able to copy files into it. Drag
   your fonts into the folder, and everyone will be able to see and use
   them.

   [9154f10.png]
   Figure 10. Have fun with your fonts!

   Now get out there and go crazy with all of your custom-installed fonts!

[71]The article is not KDE-centric

On March 18th, 2008 Andrew (not verified) says:

   Despite what the graphics may suggest, Bartolomew has provided us with
   all the information we need to install fonts in any desktop environment
   :

   - the place where we can find fonts
   - the sort of fonts that should be considered (Windows, not Mac OS)
   - the extensions of the relevant files
   - the way to open those files
   - the directories they belong to
   - the group that is allowed to install fonts system-wide
   - the way to make them available (activate them)

   The commands required to go through these steps are not complicated
   (download fonts, extract them, copy them somewhere, create a new
   directory if necessary, become root, add a user to a group, log out and
   in). So, with a basic knowledge of the command-line, readers can
   install fonts in any desktop environment, not in KDE only.

   By the way, I'm a GNOME user.

   P.S. : Does the captcha really need to be fuzzy ? It's a pain to
   decipher. I failed twice.

[85]Gnome

On March 11th, 2008 lapubell (not verified) says:

   I don't want to argue the difference between the two big desktops, but
   as a recent convert from KDE 3.5.7 to gnome, I was hoping there was a
   little more ambiguity in this article (as it is titled installing fonts
   in LINUX, not KDE). I love KDE and am really looking forward to 4.1,
   but as I use almost all GTK programs, and gnome comes pre installed on
   a standard ubuntu install, I haven't gotten around to getting KDE 3
   back on my machine.

   From the content of this article, I can tell it is aimed at beginners.
   To tell you the truth, I think it is almost more confusing saying this
   is a font install howto for Linux, as a newbie isn't going to know that
   there are options. I remember trying to help out a new comer to linux
   that was only using it for skype and the trouble shooting questions was
   all for KDE. Problem was, he used a fresh install of Ubuntu and didn't
   know that he needed to install KDE just to get the diagnostic tool that
   Skype was telling him to use. small issue, but I think that if we are a
   little clearer in our lessons, people might get it a little more. Maybe
   not though.

   Good article for a beginner on installing fonts for a KDE desktop. Keep
   it up Linux Journal.

   Your feedback was spot on - we'll take it in to account the next time
   we publish an article that is more KDE or Gnome (or whatever) heavy.

   Thanks much.

[93]Uninstalling fonts

On March 12th, 2008 From Netherlands (not verified) says:

   Thanks for the useful article. My main problem with fonts on linux is
   actually the opposite.

   I find that very often distributions (I've used Mandriva, Suse, Ubuntu)
   ship with far too many fonts - and maybe 4 out of every 5 of these
   fonts are what I would term 'Novelty' fonts. [e.g. with all due respect
   to whoever developed the 'GroovyGhosties' font - I really don't find it
   that useful - Haloween cards???]

   It would be better to ship far fewer (30 or so?) good quality fonts
   (maybe include a couple of novelty fonts too), and let the user install
   extra fonts as required. I once tried to remove many fonts from my
   system, but it took ages to evaluate/select and remove the ones I
   didn't want, and then they came back again in an update - so I've never
   tried to do this again. It might be useful if someone could suggest how
   to efficiently manage a set of good-quality set of core fonts. Maybe
   some distributions do this better, or it was my own fault for
   installing some additional fonts at some point, or maybe there is some
   way to limit fonts in /etc/X11/xorg.conf? Any suggestions welcome.

[125]August 2009, #184

   If you're a culinary type you've probably heard of Pickled Capers. This
   month, we present you with an even tastier treat: Kerneled Kapers.
   That's right Linux so good that you can eat it for dinner. We've got
   two articles about kernel scheduling: one about real time scheduling
   and the other about the Completely Fair Scheduler which appeared in
   Linux 2.6.23. We also have an article on the new Ksplice technology
   that appeared on the scene just recently. Also in this issue: find out
   how to make root unprivileged.

   And if Kapers aren't your cup of tea we have our usual buffet of
   articles: eyeOS which allows you to create your own cloud based
   desktops, using fixtures and factories with Rails, more on secure
   Squids, a review of the long awaited KOffice 2.0, Longomatch, and
   Kanatest.

   But don't leave before we serve up the "piece de resistance":
   Point/Counterpoint on Twitter.

   Apologies to Chef Marcel for borrowing his shtick.
