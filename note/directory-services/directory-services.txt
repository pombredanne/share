** A directory service is the software system that stores, organizes and provides access to information in a directory. In software engineering, a directory is a map between names and values. It allows the lookup of values given a name, similar to a dictionary.
** As a word in a dictionary may have multiple definitions, in a directory, a name may be associated with multiple, different pieces of information. Likewise, as a word may have different parts of speech and different definitions, a name in a directory may have many different types of data. 很好的比喻!!
** Directories may be very narrow in scope, supporting only a small set of node types and data types, or they may be very broad, supporting an arbitrary or extensible set of types.
** Many different directory services have been used since the advent of the Internet but this article focuses mainly on those that have descended from the X.500 directory service. 早在 Internet 出現之前，電信公司就發展出 X.500
** Each resource on the network is considered an object on the directory server. Information about a particular resource is stored as attributes of that object. Information within objects can be made secure so that only users with the available permissions are able to access it.
** A directory service defines the namespace for the network. A namespace in this context is the term that is used to hold one or more objects as named entries. The directory design process normally has a set of rules that determine how network resources are named and identified. The rules specify that the names be unique and unambiguous.
** In X.500 (the directory service standards) and LDAP the name is called the Distinguished name (DN) and is used to refer to a collection of attributes (relative distinguished names) which make up the name of a directory entry. 意思是多個 RDN 會組合一個 DN??
** Replication and Distribution have very distinct meanings in the design and management of a directory service. The term replication is used to indicate that the same directory namespace (the same objects) are copied to another directory server for redundancy and throughput reasons. The replicated namespace is governed by the same authority. The term distribution is used to indicate that multiple directory servers, that hold different namespaces, are interconnected to form a distributed directory service. Each distinct namespace can be governed by different authorities.
** directory information is read more often than it is written; this makes features related to transactions and rollback less important. 像 MongoDB 也是強調 read 多於 write 的應用
** The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, LDAP, is based on the directory information services of X.500, but uses the TCP/IP stack and a string encoding scheme of the X.500 protocol DAP, giving it more relevance on the Internet.
** Active Directory: Microsoft's modern directory service for Windows, originating from the X.500 directory （不是從 LDAP 衍生出來??）, created for use in Exchange Server, first shipped with Windows 2000 Server and is supported by successive versions of Windows.
