** Open Virtualization Format (OVF) is an open standard for packaging and distributing virtual appliances or more generally software to be run in virtual machines.
** The unit of packaging and distribution is a so-called OVF Package which may contain one or more virtual systems each of which can be deployed to a virtual machine.
** In September 2007 VMware, Dell, HP, IBM, Microsoft and XenSource submitted to the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) a proposal for OVF, then named "Open Virtual Machine Format".
** An OVF package consists of several files placed in one directory. An OVF package always contains exactly one OVF descriptor (a file with extension `.ovf`). The OVF descriptor is an XML file which describes the packaged virtual machine; it contains the metadata for the OVF package, such as name, hardware requirements, references to the other files in the OVF package and human-readable descriptions. In addition to the OVF descriptor, the OVF package will typically contain one or more disk images, and optionally certificate files and other auxiliary files.
** The entire directory can be distributed as an OVA package, which is a tar archive file with the OVF directory inside. 也就是說 `.ovf` 是個目錄，而 `.ova` 是單一隻檔案，但兩者的內容是一樣的。

** With the rapid adoption of virtualization, there is a great need for a standard way to package and distribute virtual machines. VMware and other leaders in the virtualization field have created the Open Virtualization Format (OVF), a platform independent, efficient, extensible, and open packaging and distribution format for virtual machines.
** OVF enables efficient, flexible, and secure distribution of enterprise software, facilitating the mobility of virtual machines and giving customers vendor and platform independence. Customers can deploy an OVF formatted virtual machine on the virtualization platform of their choice. 注意 "deploy OVF" 的說法，而非 "import OVF"。
** The portability and interoperability inherent in OVF will enable the growth of the virtual appliance market as well as virtualization as a whole.
** In addition to support for compression for more efficient package transfers 難怪 export 出來會小很多。
** OVF supports industry standard content verification and integrity checking, and provides a basic scheme for the management of software licensing. 這裡的 licensing 指的是什麼??
** Supports both single and multi virtual machine configurations – Virtual appliance solutions stacks may consist of one or many virtual appliances. With OVF, Software Developers can configure complex multi-tiered services consisting of multiple interdependent virtual appliances. 整組 server 虛擬化後帶著走
** OVF is virtualization platform independent, while also enabling platform-specific enhancements to be captured. 那不就會有差異了？
** Supports localization – OVF supports user visible descriptions in multiple locales, and supports localization of the interactive processes during installation of an appliance. This allows a single packaged appliance to serve multiple market opportunities
** VMDK is a file format that only encodes a single virtual disk from a virtual machine. A VMDK does not contain information about the virtual hardware of a machine, such as the CPU, memory, disk, and network information. A virtual machine may include multiple virtual disks or VMDKs. 也就是說 OVF 可以含有多個 VMDKs。
** The OVF format, on the other hand, provides a complete specification of the virtual machine. This includes the full list of required virtual disks plus the required virtual hardware configuration, including CPU, memory, networking, and storage. An administrator can quickly provision this virtual machine into virtual infrastructure with little or no manual intervention.
** VMware OVF Tool is a command line utility that supports importing and exporting of OVF packages for a wide variety of VMware platforms, including VMware Workstation, VMware Server 2.0, vSphere 4.0, and earlier versions of VMware ESX Server and VMware VirtualCenter.

** The Open Virtualization Format (OVF) is a packaging standard from Distributed Management Task Force, Inc., for portability and deployment of virtual appliances. The OVF Import/Export tool consists of cmdlets?? that enable System Center 2012 – Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) users to import and export virtual machines that are packaged in the OVF format. VMM 對 OVF 的支援要另外安裝
** The OVF format uses an XML file with the extension `.ovf` together with one or more virtual disks.
** The OVF Import/Export tool does not convert virtual hard disk file formats. (所以 virtual disk 最好也選通用的格式) You may need third-party tools to convert a virtual hard disk format. The name of the virtual hard disk that is specified in the `.ovf` file must match the actual path and name of the virtual hard disk. If you convert a file from, for instance, `.vmdk` to `.vhd`, or if you rename the virtual hard disk file, you must also edit the `.ovf` file to update the name.
** The current version of the tool supports a single virtual machine. The import and export of VMM service templates, more than one virtual machine or with deployment customizations are not currently supported.
