:title: [TCP/IP] Link-local Addresses

當系統無法從設定或 DHCP 拿到 IP 時，就會自動配發一個在 local network 裡具有唯一性的 IP，稱作 link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/16)。所以當你發現不能上網，拿到的 IP 是 169.254.x.x 時，通常是因為連不到 DHCP server 或 DHCP 發不出 IP 了。

Microsoft 習慣將這個自動配發 link-local addresses 的機制稱作 Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) 或 auto-IP。

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** Link-local addresses for IPv4 are defined in the address block 169.254.0.0/16.
** Link-local addresses are assigned to interfaces by host-internal, i.e. stateless, address autoconfiguration when other means of address assignment are not available.
** In the automatic address configuration process, network hosts select a random candidate address within the reserved range and use Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) probes to ascertain that the address is not in use on the network. If a reply is received to the ARP, it indicates the candidate IP address is already in use; a new random candidate IP address is then created and the process repeated. The process ends when there is no reply to the ARP, indicating the candidate IP address is available.
** Microsoft refers to this address autoconfiguration method as Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA).[5] It is sometimes also casually referred to as auto-IP.
