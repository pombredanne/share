** Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a protocol for live interactive Internet text messaging (chat) or synchronous conferencing. It is mainly designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-to-one communication via private message as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing. 沒想到也支援檔案的交換
** IRC was created in 1988. Client software is available for every major operating system that supports Internet access. As of April 2011, the top 100 IRC networks served more than half a million users at a time, with hundreds of thousands of channels operating on a total of roughly 1,500 servers out of roughly 3,200 servers worldwide. 好大的組織!! 這裡的 IRC networks 是相通的嗎??
** IRC is an open protocol that uses TCP and, optionally, TLS. An IRC server can connect to other IRC servers to expand the IRC network. Users access IRC networks by connecting a client to a server. 只要連接到任何一台 IRC 伺服器，就是接上整個 IRC network 嗎??
** There are many client implementations, such as mIRC, XChat and irssi, and server implementations, e.g. the original IRCd. Most IRC servers do not require users to register an account but a user will have to set a nickname before being connected.
** IRC was originally a plain text protocol (although later extended), which on request was assigned port 194/TCP by IANA. However, the de facto standard has always been to run IRC on 6667/TCP and nearby port numbers (for example TCP ports 6660–6669, 7000) to avoid having to run the IRCd software with root privileges.
** The protocol specified that characters were 8-bit but did not specify the character encoding the text was supposed to use. This can cause problems when users using different clients and/or different platforms want to converse. 怎麼設定 encoding??A more important advantage of registering your nickname with NickServ is that it allows you to register new channels with ChanServ and/or be in channel access lists. This means, among other things, that you can get channel operator status from ChanServ .
** Although many specifications on the IRC protocol have been published, there is no official specification, as the protocol remains dynamic. Virtually no clients and very few servers rely strictly on the above RFCs as a reference.
** The standard structure of a network of IRC servers is a tree. 不是網狀的 Messages are routed along only necessary branches of the tree but network state is sent to every server and there is generally a high degree of implicit trust between servers.
** Once established however, each message to multiple recipients is delivered in a fashion similar to multicast, meaning each message travels a network link exactly once. 不要跟 broadcast 搞混了
** IRC has a line-based structure with the client sending single-line messages to the server, receiving replies to those messages and receiving copies of some messages sent by other clients. In most clients users can enter commands by prefixing them with a '/'. 訊息不能多行??
** The basic means of communicating to a group of users in an established IRC session is through a channel. Channels on a network can be displayed using the IRC command LIST, which lists all currently available channels that do not have the modes +s or +p set, on that particular network. 也就是說看不到其他 network 的 channel??
** Users can join a channel using the JOIN command, in most clients available as `/join #channelname`. Messages sent to the joined channels are then relayed to all other users.
** Channels that are available across an entire IRC network are prefixed with a '#', while those local to a server use '&'.
