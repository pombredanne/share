Chapter 2. What's new in Spring 2.0 and 2.5?

2.1. Introduction

   If you have been using the Spring Framework for some time, you will be
   aware that Spring has undergone two major revisions: Spring 2.0,
   released in October 2006, and Spring 2.5, released in November 2007.

   Java SE and Java EE Support

   The Spring Framework continues to be compatible with all versions of
   Java since (and including) Java 1.4.2. This means that Java 1.4.2, Java
   5 and Java 6 are supported, although some advanced functionality of the
   Spring Framework will not be available to you if you are committed to
   using Java 1.4.2. Spring 2.5 introduces dedicated support for Java 6,
   after Spring 2.0's in-depth support for Java 5 throughout the
   framework.

   Furthermore, Spring remains compatible with J2EE 1.3 and higher, while
   at the same time introducing dedicated support for Java EE 5. This
   means that Spring can be consistently used on application servers such
   as BEA WebLogic 8.1, 9.0, 9.2 and 10, IBM WebSphere 5.1, 6.0, 6.1 and
   7, Oracle OC4J 10.1.3 and 11, JBoss 3.2, 4.0, 4.2 and 5.0, as well as
   Tomcat 4.1, 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0, Jetty 4.2, 5.1 and 6.1, Resin 2.1, 3.0
   and 3.1 and GlassFish V1 and V2.

   NOTE: We generally recommend using the most recent version of each
   application server generation. In particular, make sure you are using
   BEA WebLogic 8.1 SP6 or higher and WebSphere 6.0.2.19 / 6.1.0.9 or
   higher, respectively, when using those WebLogic and WebSphere
   generations with Spring 2.5.

   This chapter is a guide to the new and improved features of Spring 2.0
   and 2.5. It is intended to provide a high-level summary so that
   seasoned Spring architects and developers can become immediately
   familiar with the new Spring 2.x functionality. For more in-depth
   information on the features, please refer to the corresponding sections
   hyperlinked from within this chapter.

2.2. The Inversion of Control (IoC) container

   One of the areas that contains a considerable number of 2.0 and 2.5
   improvements is Spring's IoC container.

2.2.1. New bean scopes

   Previous versions of Spring had IoC container level support for exactly
   two distinct bean scopes (singleton and prototype). Spring 2.0 improves
   on this by not only providing a number of additional scopes depending
   on the environment in which Spring is being deployed (for example,
   request and session scoped beans in a web environment), but also by
   providing integration points so that Spring users can create their own
   scopes.

   It should be noted that although the underlying (and internal)
   implementation for singleton- and prototype-scoped beans has been
   changed, this change is totally transparent to the end user... no
   existing configuration needs to change, and no existing configuration
   will break.

   Both the new and the original scopes are detailed in the section
   entitled [7]Section 3.4, "Bean scopes".

2.2.2. Easier XML configuration

   Spring XML configuration is now even easier, thanks to the advent of
   the new XML configuration syntax based on XML Schema. If you want to
   take advantage of the new tags that Spring provides (and the Spring
   team certainly suggest that you do because they make configuration less
   verbose and easier to read), then do read the section entitled
   [8]Appendix A, XML Schema-based configuration.

   On a related note, there is a new, updated DTD for Spring 2.0 that you
   may wish to reference if you cannot take advantage of the XML
   Schema-based configuration. The DOCTYPE declaration is included below
   for your convenience, but the interested reader should definitely read
   the 'spring-beans-2.0.dtd' DTD included in the 'dist/resources'
   directory of the Spring 2.5 distribution.
<!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD BEAN 2.0//EN"
                  "http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans-2.0.dtd">

2.2.3. Extensible XML authoring

   Not only is XML configuration easier to write, it is now also
   extensible.

   What 'extensible' means in this context is that you, as an application
   developer, or (more likely) as a third party framework or product
   vendor, can write custom tags that other developers can then plug into
   their own Spring configuration files. This allows you to have your own
   domain specific language (the term is used loosely here) of sorts be
   reflected in the specific configuration of your own components.

   Implementing custom Spring tags may not be of interest to every single
   application developer or enterprise architect using Spring in their own
   projects. We expect third-party vendors to be highly interested in
   developing custom configuration tags for use in Spring configuration
   files.

   The extensible configuration mechanism is documented in [9]Appendix B,
   Extensible XML authoring.

2.2.4. Annotation-driven configuration

   Spring 2.0 introduced support for various annotations for configuration
   purposes, such as @Transactional, @Required and @PersistenceContext
   /@PersistenceUnit.

   Spring 2.5 introduces support for a complete set of configuration
   annotations: @Autowired in combination with support for the JSR-250
   annotations @Resource, @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy .

   Annotation-driven bean configuration is discussed in [10]Section 3.11,
   "Annotation-based configuration". Check out annotation support for
   Spring MVC as well: [11]Section 2.5.3, "Annotation-based controllers"

2.2.5. Autodetecting components in the classpath

   Spring 2.5 introduces support component scanning: autodetecting
   annotated components in the classpath. Typically, such component
   classes will be annotated with stereotypes such as @Component,
   @Repository, @Service, @Controller. Depending on the application
   context configuration, such component classes will be autodetected and
   turned into Spring bean definitions, not requiring explicit
   configuration for each such bean.

   Annotation-driven bean configuration is discussed in
   [12]Section 3.12.1, "@Component and further stereotype annotations".

2.3. Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)

   Spring 2.0 has a much improved AOP offering. The Spring AOP framework
   itself is markedly easier to configure in XML, and significantly less
   verbose as a result; and Spring 2.0 integrates with the AspectJ
   pointcut language and @AspectJ aspect declaration style. The chapter
   entitled [13]Chapter 6, Aspect Oriented Programming with Spring is
   dedicated to describing this new support.

2.3.1. Easier AOP XML configuration

   Spring 2.0 introduces new schema support for defining aspects backed by
   regular Java objects. This support takes advantage of the AspectJ
   pointcut language and offers fully typed advice (i.e. no more casting
   and Object[] argument manipulation). Details of this support can be
   found in the section entitled [14]Section 6.3, "Schema-based AOP
   support".

2.3.2. Support for @AspectJ aspects

   Spring 2.0 also supports aspects defined using the @AspectJ
   annotations. These aspects can be shared between AspectJ and Spring
   AOP, and require (honestly!) only some simple configuration. Said
   support for @AspectJ aspects is discussed in [15]Section 6.2, "@AspectJ
   support".

2.3.3. Support for bean name pointcut element

   Spring 2.5 introduces support for the bean(...) pointcut element,
   matching specific named beans according to Spring-defined bean names.
   See [16]Section 6.2.3.1, "Supported Pointcut Designators" for details.

2.3.4. Support for AspectJ load-time weaving

   Spring 2.5 introduces explicit support AspectJ load-time weaving, as
   alternative to the proxy-based AOP framework. The new
   context:load-time-weaver configuration element automatically activates
   AspectJ aspects as defined in AspectJ's META-INF/aop.xml descriptor,
   applying them to the current application context through registering a
   transformer with the underlying ClassLoader. Note that this only works
   in environments with class transformation support. Check out
   [17]Section 6.8.4, "Load-time weaving with AspectJ in the Spring
   Framework" for the capabilities and limitations.

2.4. The Middle Tier

2.4.1. Easier configuration of declarative transactions in XML

   The way that transactions are configured in Spring 2.0 has been changed
   significantly. The previous 1.2.x style of configuration continues to
   be valid (and supported), but the new style is markedly less verbose
   and is the recommended style. Spring 2.0 also ships with an AspectJ
   aspects library that you can use to make pretty much any object
   transactional - even objects not created by the Spring IoC container.

   Spring 2.5 supports convenient annotation-driven transaction management
   in combination with load-time weaving, through the use of
   context:load-time-weaver in combination with tx:annotation-driven
   mode="aspectj".

   The chapter entitled [18]Chapter 9, Transaction management contains all
   of the details.

2.4.2. Full WebSphere transaction management support

   Spring 2.5 explicitly supports IBM's WebSphere Application Server, in
   particular with respect to WebSphere's transaction manager. Transaction
   suspension is now fully supported through the use of WebSphere's new
   UOWManager API, which is available on WAS 6.0.2.19+ and 6.0.1.9+.

   So if you run a Spring-based application on the WebSphere Application
   Server, we highly recommend to use Spring 2.5's
   WebSphereUowTransactionManager as your PlatformTransactionManager of
   choice. This is also IBM's official recommendation.

   For automatic detection of the underlying JTA-based transaction
   platform, consider the use of Spring 2.5's new
   tx:jta-transaction-manager configuration element. This will autodetect
   BEA WebLogic and IBM WebSphere, registering the appropriate
   PlatformTransactionManager.

2.4.3. JPA

   Spring 2.0 ships with a JPA abstraction layer that is similar in intent
   to Spring's JDBC abstraction layer in terms of scope and general usage
   patterns.

   If you are interested in using a JPA-implementation as the backbone of
   your persistence layer, the section entitled [19]Section 12.6, "JPA" is
   dedicated to detailing Spring's support and value-add in this area.

   Spring 2.5 upgrades its OpenJPA support to OpenJPA 1.0, with support
   for advanced features such as savepoints.

2.4.4. Asynchronous JMS

   Prior to Spring 2.0, Spring's JMS offering was limited to sending
   messages and the synchronous receiving of messages. This functionality
   (encapsulated in the JmsTemplate class) is great, but it doesn't
   address the requirement for the asynchronous receiving of messages.

   Spring 2.0 now ships with full support for the reception of messages in
   an asynchronous fashion, as detailed in the section entitled
   [20]Section 19.4.2, "Asynchronous Reception - Message-Driven POJOs".

   As of Spring 2.5, the JCA style of setting up asynchronous message
   listeners is supported as well, through the
   GenericMessageEndpointManager facility. This is an alternative to the
   standard JMS listener facility, allowing closer integration with
   message brokers such as ActiveMQ and JORAM. See [21]Section 19.5,
   "Support for JCA Message Endpoints".

   Spring 2.5 also introduces an XML namespace for simplifying JMS
   configuration, offering concise configuration of a large numbers of
   listeners. This namespace supports both the standard JMS listener
   facility as well as the JCA setup style, with minimal changes in the
   configuration. See [22]Section 19.6, "JMS Namespace Support".

2.4.5. JDBC

   There are some small (but nevertheless notable) new classes in the
   Spring Framework's JDBC support library. The first,
   [23]NamedParameterJdbcTemplate, provides support for programming JDBC
   statements using named parameters (as opposed to programming JDBC
   statements using only classic placeholder ('?') arguments.

   Another of the new classes, the [24]SimpleJdbcTemplate, is aimed at
   making using the JdbcTemplate even easier to use when you are
   developing against Java 5+ (Tiger).

   Spring 2.5 significantly extends the functionality of
   SimpleJdbcTemplate and introduces SimpleJdbcCall and SimpleJdbcInsert
   operation objects.

2.5. The Web Tier

   The web tier support has been substantially improved and expanded in
   Spring 2.0, with annotation-based controllers introduced in Spring 2.5.

2.5.1. Sensible defaulting in Spring MVC

   For a lot of projects, sticking to established conventions and having
   reasonable defaults is just what the projects need... this theme of
   convention-over-configuration now has explicit support in Spring MVC.
   What this means is that if you establish a set of naming conventions
   for your Controllers and views, you can substantially cut down on the
   amount of XML configuration that is required to setup handler mappings,
   view resolvers, ModelAndView instances, etc. This is a great boon with
   regards to rapid prototyping, and can also lend a degree of (always
   good-to-have) consistency across a codebase.

   Spring MVC's convention-over-configuration support is detailed in the
   section entitled [25]Section 13.10, "Convention over configuration"

2.5.2. Portlet framework

   Spring 2.0 ships with a Portlet framework that is conceptually similar
   to the Spring MVC framework. Detailed coverage of the Spring Portlet
   framework can be found in the section entitled [26]Chapter 16, Portlet
   MVC Framework.

2.5.3. Annotation-based controllers

   Spring 2.5 introduces an annotation-based programming model for MVC
   controllers, using annotations such as @RequestMapping, @RequestParam,
   @ModelAttribute, etc. This annotation support is available for both
   Servlet MVC and Portlet MVC. Controllers implemented in this style do
   not have to extend specific base classes or implement specific
   interfaces. Furthermore, they do not usually have direct dependencies
   on Servlet or Portlet API's, although they can easily get access to
   Servlet or Portlet facilities if desired. For further details, see
   [27]Section 13.11, "Annotation-based controller configuration".

2.5.4. A form tag library for Spring MVC

   A rich JSP tag library for Spring MVC was the JIRA issue that garnered
   the most votes from Spring users (by a wide margin).

   Spring 2.0 ships with a full featured JSP tag library that makes the
   job of authoring JSP pages much easier when using Spring MVC; the
   Spring team is confident it will satisfy all of those developers who
   voted for the issue on JIRA. The new tag library is itself covered in
   the section entitled [28]Section 14.2.4, "Using Spring's form tag
   library", and a quick reference to all of the new tags can be found in
   the appendix entitled [29]Appendix E, spring-form.tld.

2.5.5. Tiles 2 support

   Spring 2.5 ships support for Tiles 2, the next generation of the
   popular Tiles templating framework. This supersedes Spring's former
   support for Tiles 1, as included in Struts 1.x. See [30]Section 14.3,
   "Tiles" for details.

2.5.6. JSF 1.2 support

   Spring 2.5 supports JSF 1.2, providing a JSF 1.2 variant of Spring's
   DelegatingVariableResolver in the form of the new
   SpringBeanFacesELResolver.

2.5.7. JAX-WS support

   Spring 2.5 fully supports JAX-WS 2.0/2.1, as included in Java 6 and
   Java EE 5. JAX-WS is the successor of JAX-RPC, allowing access to
   WSDL/SOAP-based web services as well as JAX-WS style exposure of web
   services.

2.6. Everything else

   This final section outlines all of the other new and improved Spring
   2.0/2.5 features and functionality.

2.6.1. Dynamic language support

   Spring 2.0 introduced support for beans written in languages other than
   Java, with the currently supported dynamic languages being JRuby,
   Groovy and BeanShell. This dynamic language support is comprehensively
   detailed in the section entitled [31]Chapter 24, Dynamic language
   support.

   Spring 2.5 refines the dynamic languages support with autowiring and
   support for the recently released JRuby 1.0.

2.6.2. Enhanced testing support

   Spring 2.5 introduces the Spring TestContext Framework which provides
   annotation-driven unit and integration testing support that is agnostic
   of the actual testing framework in use. The same techniques and
   annotation-based configuration used in, for example, a JUnit 3.8
   environment can also be applied to tests written with JUnit 4.4,
   TestNG, etc.

   In addition to providing generic and extensible testing infrastructure,
   the Spring TestContext Framework provides out-of-the-box support for
   Spring-specific integration testing functionality such as [32]context
   management and caching, [33]dependency injection of test fixtures, and
   [34]transactional test management with default rollback semantics.

   To discover how this new testing support can assist you with writing
   unit and integration tests, consult [35]Section 8.3.7, "Spring
   TestContext Framework" of the revised testing chapter.

2.6.3. JMX support

   The Spring Framework 2.0 has support for Notifications; it is also
   possible to exercise declarative control over the registration behavior
   of MBeans with an MBeanServer.
     * [36]Section 20.7, "Notifications"
     * [37]Section 20.2.5, "Controlling the registration behavior"

   Furthermore, Spring 2.5 provides a [38]context:mbean-export
   configuration element for convenient registration of annotated bean
   classes, detecting Spring's @ManagedResource annotation.

2.6.4. Deploying a Spring application context as JCA adapter

   Spring 2.5 supports the deployment of a Spring application context as
   JCA resource adapter, packaged as a JCA RAR file. This allows headless
   application modules to be deployed into J2EE servers, getting access to
   all the server's infrastructure e.g. for executing scheduled tasks,
   listening for incoming messages, etc.

2.6.5. Task scheduling

   Spring 2.0 offers an abstraction around the scheduling of tasks. For
   the interested developer, the section entitled [39]Section 23.4, "The
   Spring TaskExecutor abstraction" contains all of the details.

   The TaskExecutor abstraction is used throughout the framework itself as
   well, e.g. for the asynchronous JMS support. In Spring 2.5, it is also
   used in the JCA environment support.

2.6.6. Java 5 (Tiger) support

   Find below pointers to documentation describing some of the new Java 5
   support in Spring 2.0 and 2.5.
     * [40]Section 3.11, "Annotation-based configuration"
     * [41]Section 25.3.1, "@Required"
     * [42]Section 9.5.6, "Using @Transactional"
     * [43]Section 11.2.3, "SimpleJdbcTemplate"
     * [44]Section 12.6, "JPA"
     * [45]Section 6.2, "@AspectJ support"
     * [46]Section 6.8.1, "Using AspectJ to dependency inject domain
       objects with Spring"

2.7. Migrating to Spring 2.5

   This final section details issues that may arise during any migration
   from Spring 1.2/2.0 to Spring 2.5.

   Upgrading to Spring 2.5 from a Spring 2.0.x application should simply
   be a matter of dropping the Spring 2.5 jar into the appropriate
   location in your application's directory structure. We highly recommend
   upgrading to Spring 2.5 from any Spring 2.0 application that runs on
   JDK 1.4.2 or higher, in particular when running on Java 5 or higher,
   leveraging the significant configuration conveniences and performance
   improvements that Spring 2.5 has to offer.

   Whether an upgrade from Spring 1.2.x will be as seamless depends on how
   much of the Spring APIs you are using in your code. Spring 2.0 removed
   pretty much all of the classes and methods previously marked as
   deprecated in the Spring 1.2.x codebase, so if you have been using such
   classes and methods, you will of course have to use alternative classes
   and methods (some of which are summarized below).

   With regards to configuration, Spring 1.2.x style XML configuration is
   100%, satisfaction-guaranteed compatible with the Spring 2.5 library.
   Of course if you are still using the Spring 1.2.x DTD, then you won't
   be able to take advantage of some of the new Spring 2.0 functionality
   (such as [47]scopes and [48]easier AOP and [49]transaction
   configuration), but nothing will blow up.

   The suggested migration strategy is to drop in the Spring 2.5 jar(s) to
   benefit from the improved code present in the release (bug fixes,
   optimizations, etc.). You can then, on an incremental basis, choose to
   start using the new Spring 2.5 features and configuration. For example,
   you could choose to start configuring just your aspects in the new
   Spring 2 style; it is perfectly valid to have 90% of your configuration
   using the old-school Spring 1.2.x configuration (which references the
   1.2.x DTD), and have the other 10% using the new Spring 2 configuration
   (which references the 2.0/2.5 DTD or XSD). Bear in mind that you are
   not forced to upgrade your XML configuration should you choose to drop
   in the Spring 2.5 libraries.

2.7.1. Changes

   For a comprehensive list of changes, consult the 'changelog.txt' file
   that is located in the top level directory of the Spring Framework
   distribution.

2.7.1.1. Supported JDK versions

   As of Spring 2.5, support for JDK 1.3 has been removed, following Sun's
   official deprecation of JDK 1.3 in late 2006. If you haven't done so
   already, upgrade to JDK 1.4.2 or higher.

   If you need to stick with an application server that only supports JDK
   1.3, such as WebSphere 4.0 or 5.0, we recommend using the Spring
   Framework version 2.0.7/2.0.8 which still supports JDK 1.3.

2.7.1.2. Jar packaging in Spring 2.5

   As of Spring 2.5, Spring Web MVC is no longer part of the 'spring.jar'
   file. Spring MVC can be found in 'spring-webmvc.jar' and
   'spring-webmvc-portlet.jar' in the lib/modules directory of the
   distribution. Furthermore, the Struts 1.x support has been factored out
   into 'spring-webmvc-struts.jar'.

   Note: The commonly used Spring's DispatcherServlet is part of Spring's
   Web MVC framework. As a consequence, you need to add
   'spring-webmvc.jar' (or 'spring-webmvc-portlet/struts.jar') to a
   'spring.jar' scenario, even if you are just using DispatcherServlet for
   remoting purposes (e.g. exporting Hessian or HTTP invoker services).

   Spring 2.0's 'spring-jmx.jar' and 'spring-remoting.jar' have been
   merged into Spring 2.5's 'spring-context.jar' (for the JMX and non-HTTP
   remoting support) and partly into 'spring-web.jar' (for the HTTP
   remoting support).

   Spring 2.0's 'spring-support.jar' has been renamed to
   'spring-context-support.jar', expressing the actual support
   relationship more closely. 'spring-portlet.jar' has been renamed to
   'spring-webmvc-portlet.jar', since it is technically a submodule of
   Spring's Web MVC framework. Analogously, 'spring-struts.jar' has been
   renamed to 'spring-webmvc-struts.jar'.

   Spring 2.0's 'spring-jdo.jar', 'spring-jpa.jar',
   'spring-hibernate3.jar', 'spring-toplink.jar' and 'spring-ibatis.jar'
   have been combined into Spring 2.5's coarse-granular 'spring-orm.jar'.

   Spring 2.5's 'spring-test.jar' supersedes the previous
   'spring-mock.jar', indicating the stronger focus on the test context
   framework. Note that 'spring-test.jar' contains everything
   'spring-mock.jar' contained in previous Spring versions; hence it can
   be used as a straightforward replacement for unit and integration
   testing purposes.

   Spring 2.5's 'spring-tx.jar' supersedes the previous 'spring-dao.jar'
   and 'spring-jca.jar' files, indicating the stronger focus on the
   transaction framework.

   Spring 2.5 ships its framework jars as OSGi-compliant bundles out of
   the box. This facilitates use of Spring in OSGi environments, not
   requiring custom packaging anymore.

2.7.1.3. XML configuration

   Spring 2.0 ships with XSDs that describe Spring's XML metadata format
   in a much richer fashion than the DTD that shipped with previous
   versions. The old DTD is still fully supported, but if possible you are
   encouraged to reference the XSD files at the top of your bean
   definition files.

   One thing that has changed in a (somewhat) breaking fashion is the way
   that bean scopes are defined. If you are using the Spring 1.2 DTD you
   can continue to use the 'singleton' attribute. You can however choose
   to [50]reference the new Spring 2.0 DTD which does not permit the use
   of the 'singleton' attribute, but rather uses the 'scope' attribute to
   define the bean lifecycle scope.

2.7.1.4. Deprecated classes and methods

   A number of classes and methods that previously were marked as
   @deprecated have been removed from the Spring 2.0 codebase. The Spring
   team decided that the 2.0 release marked a fresh start of sorts, and
   that any deprecated 'cruft' was better excised now instead of
   continuing to haunt the codebase for the foreseeable future.

   As mentioned previously, for a comprehensive list of changes, consult
   the 'changelog.txt' file that is located in the top level directory of
   the Spring Framework distribution.

   The following classes/interfaces have been removed as of Spring 2.0:
     * ResultReader : Use the RowMapper interface instead.
     * BeanFactoryBootstrap : Consider using a BeanFactoryLocator or a
       custom bootstrap class instead.

2.7.1.5. Apache OJB

   As of Spring 2.0, support for Apache OJB was totally removed from the
   main Spring source tree. The Apache OJB integration library is still
   available, but can be found in its new home in the [51]Spring Modules
   project.

2.7.1.6. iBATIS

   Please note that support for iBATIS SQL Maps 1.3 has been removed. If
   you haven't done so already, upgrade to iBATIS SQL Maps 2.3.

2.7.1.7. Hibernate

   As of Spring 2.5, support for Hibernate 2.1 and Hibernate 3.0 has been
   removed. If you haven't done so already, upgrade to Hibernate 3.1 or
   higher.

   If you need to stick with Hibernate 2.1 or 3.0 for the time being, we
   recommend to keep using the Spring Framework version 2.0.7/2.0.8 which
   still supports those versions of Hibernate.

2.7.1.8. JDO

   As of Spring 2.5, support for JDO 1.0 has been removed. If you haven't
   done so already, upgrade to JDO 2.0 or higher.

   If you need to stick with JDO 1.0 for the time being, we recommend to
   keep using the Spring Framework version 2.0.7/2.0.8 which still
   supports that version of JDO.

2.7.1.9. UrlFilenameViewController

   Since Spring 2.0, the view name that is determined by the
   UrlFilenameViewController now takes into account the nested path of the
   request. This is a breaking change from the original contract of the
   UrlFilenameViewController, and means that if you are upgrading from
   Spring 1.x to Spring 2.x and you are using this class you might have to
   change your Spring Web MVC configuration slightly. Refer to the class
   level Javadocs of the UrlFilenameViewController to see examples of the
   new contract for view name determination.

2.8. Updated sample applications

   A number of the sample applications have also been updated to showcase
   the new and improved features of Spring 2.0. So do take the time to
   investigate them. The aforementioned sample applications can be found
   in the 'samples' directory of the full Spring distribution
   ('spring-with-dependencies.[zip|tar.gz]').

   Spring 2.5 features revised versions of the PetClinic and PetPortal
   sample applications, reengineered from the ground up for leveraging
   Spring 2.5's annotation configuration features. It also uses Java 5
   autoboxing, generics, varargs and the enhanced for loop. A Java 5 or 6
   SDK is now required to build and run the sample. Check out PetClinic
   and PetPortal to get an impression of what Spring 2.5 has to offer!

2.9. Improved documentation

   The Spring reference documentation has also substantially been updated
   to reflect all of the above features new in Spring 2.0 and 2.5. While
   every effort has been made to ensure that there are no errors in this
   documentation, some errors may nevertheless have crept in. If you do
   spot any typos or even more serious errors, and you can spare a few
   cycles during lunch, please do bring the error to the attention of the
   Spring team by [52]raising an issue.

   Special thanks to Arthur Loder for his tireless proofreading of the
   Spring Framework reference documentation and JavaDocs.
