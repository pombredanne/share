Core Technologies

   This initial part of the reference documentation covers all of those
   technologies that are absolutely integral to the Spring Framework.

   Foremost amongst these is the Spring Framework's Inversion of Control
   (IoC) container. A thorough treatment of the Spring Framework's IoC
   container is closely followed by comprehensive coverage of Spring's
   Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) technologies. The Spring Framework
   has its own AOP framework, which is conceptually easy to understand,
   and which successfully addresses the 80% sweet spot of AOP requirements
   in Java enterprise programming.

   Coverage of Spring's integration with AspectJ (currently the richest -
   in terms of features - and certainly most mature AOP implementation in
   the Java enterprise space) is also provided.

   Finally, the adoption of the test-driven-development (TDD) approach to
   software development is certainly advocated by the Spring team, and so
   coverage of Spring's support for integration testing is covered
   (alongside best practices for unit testing). The Spring team have found
   that the correct use of IoC certainly does make both unit and
   integration testing easier (in that the presence of setter methods and
   appropriate constructors on classes makes them easier to wire together
   on a test without having to set up service locator registries and
   suchlike)... the chapter dedicated solely to testing will hopefully
   convince you of this as well.
