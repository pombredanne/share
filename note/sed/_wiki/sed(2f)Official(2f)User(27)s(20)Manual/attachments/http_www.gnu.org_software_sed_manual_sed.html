1 Introduction

   sed is a stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic text
   transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).
   While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits
   (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and
   is consequently more efficient. But it is sed's ability to filter text
   in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of
   editors.

2 Invocation

   Normally sed is invoked like this:
     sed SCRIPT INPUTFILE...

   The full format for invoking sed is:
     sed OPTIONS... [SCRIPT] [INPUTFILE...]

   If you do not specify INPUTFILE, or if INPUTFILE is -, sed filters the
   contents of the standard input. The script is actually the first
   non-option parameter, which sed specially considers a script and not an
   input file if (and only if) none of the other options specifies a
   script to be executed, that is if neither of the -e and -f options is
   specified.

   sed may be invoked with the following command-line options:

   --version
          Print out the version of sed that is being run and a copyright
          notice, then exit.

   --help
          Print a usage message briefly summarizing these command-line
          options and the bug-reporting address, then exit.

   -n
   --quiet
   --silent
          By default, sed prints out the pattern space at the end of each
          cycle through the script. These options disable this automatic
          printing, and sed only produces output when explicitly told to
          via the p command.

   -e script
   --expression=script
          Add the commands in script to the set of commands to be run
          while processing the input.

   -f script-file
   --file=script-file
          Add the commands contained in the file script-file to the set of
          commands to be run while processing the input.

   -i[SUFFIX]
   --in-place[=SUFFIX]
          This option specifies that files are to be edited in-place. GNU
          sed does this by creating a temporary file and sending output to
          this file rather than to the standard output.^1.

          This option implies -s.

          When the end of the file is reached, the temporary file is
          renamed to the output file's original name. The extension, if
          supplied, is used to modify the name of the old file before
          renaming the temporary file, thereby making a backup copy^2).

          This rule is followed: if the extension doesn't contain a *,
          then it is appended to the end of the current filename as a
          suffix; if the extension does contain one or more * characters,
          then each asterisk is replaced with the current filename. This
          allows you to add a prefix to the backup file, instead of (or in
          addition to) a suffix, or even to place backup copies of the
          original files into another directory (provided the directory
          already exists).

          If no extension is supplied, the original file is overwritten
          without making a backup.

   -l N
   --line-length=N
          Specify the default line-wrap length for the l command. A length
          of 0 (zero) means to never wrap long lines. If not specified, it
          is taken to be 70.

   --posix
          GNU sed includes several extensions to POSIX sed. In order to
          simplify writing portable scripts, this option disables all the
          extensions that this manual documents, including additional
          commands. Most of the extensions accept sed programs that are
          outside the syntax mandated by POSIX, but some of them (such as
          the behavior of the N command described in see Reporting Bugs)
          actually violate the standard. If you want to disable only the
          latter kind of extension, you can set the POSIXLY_CORRECT
          variable to a non-empty value.

   -b
   --binary
          This option is available on every platform, but is only
          effective where the operating system makes a distinction between
          text files and binary files. When such a distinction is made—as
          is the case for MS-DOS, Windows, Cygwin—text files are composed
          of lines separated by a carriage return and a line feed
          character, and sed does not see the ending CR. When this option
          is specified, sed will open input files in binary mode, thus not
          requesting this special processing and considering lines to end
          at a line feed.

   --follow-symlinks
          This option is available only on platforms that support symbolic
          links and has an effect only if option -i is specified. In this
          case, if the file that is specified on the command line is a
          symbolic link, sed will follow the link and edit the ultimate
          destination of the link. The default behavior is to break the
          symbolic link, so that the link destination will not be
          modified.

   -r
   --regexp-extended
          Use extended regular expressions rather than basic regular
          expressions. Extended regexps are those that egrep accepts; they
          can be clearer because they usually have less backslashes, but
          are a GNU extension and hence scripts that use them are not
          portable. See Extended regular expressions.

   -s
   --separate
          By default, sed will consider the files specified on the command
          line as a single continuous long stream. This GNU sed extension
          allows the user to consider them as separate files: range
          addresses (such as `/abc/,/def/') are not allowed to span
          several files, line numbers are relative to the start of each
          file, $ refers to the last line of each file, and files invoked
          from the R commands are rewound at the start of each file.

   -u
   --unbuffered
          Buffer both input and output as minimally as practical. (This is
          particularly useful if the input is coming from the likes of
          `tail -f', and you wish to see the transformed output as soon as
          possible.)

   If no -e, -f, --expression, or --file options are given on the
   command-line, then the first non-option argument on the command line is
   taken to be the script to be executed.

   If any command-line parameters remain after processing the above, these
   parameters are interpreted as the names of input files to be processed.
   A file name of `-' refers to the standard input stream. The standard
   input will be processed if no file names are specified.

3 sed Programs

   A sed program consists of one or more sed commands, passed in by one or
   more of the -e, -f, --expression, and --file options, or the first
   non-option argument if zero of these options are used. This document
   will refer to “the” sed script; this is understood to mean the in-order
   catenation of all of the scripts and script-files passed in.

   Each sed command consists of an optional address or address range,
   followed by a one-character command name and any additional
   command-specific code.

  3.1 How sed Works

   sed maintains two data buffers: the active pattern space, and the
   auxiliary hold space. Both are initially empty.

   sed operates by performing the following cycle on each lines of input:
   first, sed reads one line from the input stream, removes any trailing
   newline, and places it in the pattern space. Then commands are
   executed; each command can have an address associated to it: addresses
   are a kind of condition code, and a command is only executed if the
   condition is verified before the command is to be executed.

   When the end of the script is reached, unless the -n option is in use,
   the contents of pattern space are printed out to the output stream,
   adding back the trailing newline if it was removed.^3 Then the next
   cycle starts for the next input line.

   Unless special commands (like `D') are used, the pattern space is
   deleted between two cycles. The hold space, on the other hand, keeps
   its data between cycles (see commands `h', `H', `x', `g', `G' to move
   data between both buffers).

  3.2 Selecting lines with sed

   Addresses in a sed script can be in any of the following forms:

   number
          Specifying a line number will match only that line in the input.
          (Note that sed counts lines continuously across all input files
          unless -i or -s options are specified.)

   first~step
          This GNU extension matches every stepth line starting with line
          first. In particular, lines will be selected when there exists a
          non-negative n such that the current line-number equals first +
          (n * step). Thus, to select the odd-numbered lines, one would
          use 1~2; to pick every third line starting with the second,
          `2~3' would be used; to pick every fifth line starting with the
          tenth, use `10~5'; and `50~0' is just an obscure way of saying
          50.

   $
          This address matches the last line of the last file of input, or
          the last line of each file when the -i or -s options are
          specified.

   /regexp/
          This will select any line which matches the regular expression
          regexp. If regexp itself includes any / characters, each must be
          escaped by a backslash (\).

          The empty regular expression `//' repeats the last regular
          expression match (the same holds if the empty regular expression
          is passed to the s command). Note that modifiers to regular
          expressions are evaluated when the regular expression is
          compiled, thus it is invalid to specify them together with the
          empty regular expression.

   \%regexp%
          (The % may be replaced by any other single character.)

          This also matches the regular expression regexp, but allows one
          to use a different delimiter than /. This is particularly useful
          if the regexp itself contains a lot of slashes, since it avoids
          the tedious escaping of every /. If regexp itself includes any
          delimiter characters, each must be escaped by a backslash (\).

   /regexp/I
   \%regexp%I
          The I modifier to regular-expression matching is a GNU extension
          which causes the regexp to be matched in a case-insensitive
          manner.

   /regexp/M
   \%regexp%M
          The M modifier to regular-expression matching is a GNU sed
          extension which causes ^ and $ to match respectively (in
          addition to the normal behavior) the empty string after a
          newline, and the empty string before a newline. There are
          special character sequences (\` and \') which always match the
          beginning or the end of the buffer. M stands for multi-line.

   If no addresses are given, then all lines are matched; if one address
   is given, then only lines matching that address are matched.

   An address range can be specified by specifying two addresses separated
   by a comma (,). An address range matches lines starting from where the
   first address matches, and continues until the second address matches
   (inclusively).

   If the second address is a regexp, then checking for the ending match
   will start with the line following the line which matched the first
   address: a range will always span at least two lines (except of course
   if the input stream ends).

   If the second address is a number less than (or equal to) the line
   matching the first address, then only the one line is matched.

   GNU sed also supports some special two-address forms; all these are GNU
   extensions:

   0,/regexp/
          A line number of 0 can be used in an address specification like
          0,/regexp/ so that sed will try to match regexp in the first
          input line too. In other words, 0,/regexp/ is similar to
          1,/regexp/, except that if addr2 matches the very first line of
          input the 0,/regexp/ form will consider it to end the range,
          whereas the 1,/regexp/ form will match the beginning of its
          range and hence make the range span up to the second occurrence
          of the regular expression.

          Note that this is the only place where the 0 address makes
          sense; there is no 0-th line and commands which are given the 0
          address in any other way will give an error.

   addr1,+N
          Matches addr1 and the N lines following addr1.

   addr1,~N
          Matches addr1 and the lines following addr1 until the next line
          whose input line number is a multiple of N.

   Appending the ! character to the end of an address specification
   negates the sense of the match. That is, if the ! character follows an
   address range, then only lines which do not match the address range
   will be selected. This also works for singleton addresses, and, perhaps
   perversely, for the null address.

  3.3 Overview of Regular Expression Syntax

   To know how to use sed, people should understand regular expressions
   (regexp for short). A regular expression is a pattern that is matched
   against a subject string from left to right. Most characters are
   ordinary: they stand for themselves in a pattern, and match the
   corresponding characters in the subject. As a trivial example, the
   pattern
          The quick brown fox

   matches a portion of a subject string that is identical to itself. The
   power of regular expressions comes from the ability to include
   alternatives and repetitions in the pattern. These are encoded in the
   pattern by the use of special characters, which do not stand for
   themselves but instead are interpreted in some special way. Here is a
   brief description of regular expression syntax as used in sed.

   char
          A single ordinary character matches itself.

   *
          Matches a sequence of zero or more instances of matches for the
          preceding regular expression, which must be an ordinary
          character, a special character preceded by \, a ., a grouped
          regexp (see below), or a bracket expression. As a GNU extension,
          a postfixed regular expression can also be followed by *; for
          example, a** is equivalent to a*. POSIX 1003.1-2001 says that *
          stands for itself when it appears at the start of a regular
          expression or subexpression, but many nonGNU implementations do
          not support this and portable scripts should instead use \* in
          these contexts.

   \+
          As *, but matches one or more. It is a GNU extension.

   \?
          As *, but only matches zero or one. It is a GNU extension.

   \{i\}
          As *, but matches exactly i sequences (i is a decimal integer;
          for portability, keep it between 0 and 255 inclusive).

   \{i,j\}
          Matches between i and j, inclusive, sequences.

   \{i,\}
          Matches more than or equal to i sequences.

   \(regexp\)
          Groups the inner regexp as a whole, this is used to:

          + Apply postfix operators, like \(abcd\)*: this will search for
            zero or more whole sequences of `abcd', while abcd* would
            search for `abc' followed by zero or more occurrences of `d'.
            Note that support for \(abcd\)* is required by POSIX
            1003.1-2001, but many non-GNU implementations do not support
            it and hence it is not universally portable.
          + Use back references (see below).

   .
          Matches any character, including newline.

   ^
          Matches the null string at beginning of line, i.e. what appears
          after the circumflex must appear at the beginning of line.
          ^#include will match only lines where `#include' is the first
          thing on line—if there are spaces before, for example, the match
          fails. ^ acts as a special character only at the beginning of
          the regular expression or subexpression (that is, after \( or
          \|). Portable scripts should avoid ^ at the beginning of a
          subexpression, though, as POSIX allows implementations that
          treat ^ as an ordinary character in that context.

   $
          It is the same as ^, but refers to end of line. $ also acts as a
          special character only at the end of the regular expression or
          subexpression (that is, before \) or \|), and its use at the end
          of a subexpression is not portable.

   [list]
   [^list]
          Matches any single character in list: for example, [aeiou]
          matches all vowels. A list may include sequences like
          char1-char2, which matches any character between (inclusive)
          char1 and char2.

          A leading ^ reverses the meaning of list, so that it matches any
          single character not in list. To include ] in the list, make it
          the first character (after the ^ if needed), to include - in the
          list, make it the first or last; to include ^ put it after the
          first character.

          The characters $, *, ., [, and \ are normally not special within
          list. For example, [\*] matches either `\' or `*', because the \
          is not special here. However, strings like [.ch.], [=a=], and
          [:space:] are special within list and represent collating
          symbols, equivalence classes, and character classes,
          respectively, and [ is therefore special within list when it is
          followed by ., =, or :. Also, when not in POSIXLY_CORRECT mode,
          special escapes like \n and \t are recognized within list. See
          Escapes.

   regexp1\|regexp2
          Matches either regexp1 or regexp2. Use parentheses to use
          complex alternative regular expressions. The matching process
          tries each alternative in turn, from left to right, and the
          first one that succeeds is used. It is a GNU extension.

   regexp1regexp2
          Matches the concatenation of regexp1 and regexp2. Concatenation
          binds more tightly than \|, ^, and $, but less tightly than the
          other regular expression operators.

   \digit
          Matches the digit-th \(...\) parenthesized subexpression in the
          regular expression. This is called a back reference.
          Subexpressions are implicity numbered by counting occurrences of
          \( left-to-right.

   \n
          Matches the newline character.

   \char
          Matches char, where char is one of $, *, ., [, \, or ^. Note
          that the only C-like backslash sequences that you can portably
          assume to be interpreted are \n and \\; in particular \t is not
          portable, and matches a `t' under most implementations of sed,
          rather than a tab character.

   Note that the regular expression matcher is greedy, i.e., matches are
   attempted from left to right and, if two or more matches are possible
   starting at the same character, it selects the longest.

   Examples:

   `abcdef'
          Matches `abcdef'.

   `a*b'
          Matches zero or more `a's followed by a single `b'. For example,
          `b' or `aaaaab'.

   `a\?b'
          Matches `b' or `ab'.

   `a\+b\+'
          Matches one or more `a's followed by one or more `b's: `ab' is
          the shortest possible match, but other examples are `aaaab' or
          `abbbbb' or `aaaaaabbbbbbb'.

   `.*'
   `.\+'
          These two both match all the characters in a string; however,
          the first matches every string (including the empty string),
          while the second matches only strings containing at least one
          character.

   `^main.*(.*)'
          his matches a string starting with `main', followed by an
          opening and closing parenthesis. The `n', `(' and `)' need not
          be adjacent.

   `^#'
          This matches a string beginning with `#'.

   `\\$'
          This matches a string ending with a single backslash. The regexp
          contains two backslashes for escaping.

   `\$'
          Instead, this matches a string consisting of a single dollar
          sign, because it is escaped.

   `[a-zA-Z0-9]'
          In the C locale, this matches any ASCII letters or digits.

   `[^ tab]\+'
          (Here tab stands for a single tab character.) This matches a
          string of one or more characters, none of which is a space or a
          tab. Usually this means a word.

   `^\(.*\)\n\1$'
          This matches a string consisting of two equal substrings
          separated by a newline.

   `.\{9\}A$'
          This matches nine characters followed by an `A'.

   `^.\{15\}A'
          This matches the start of a string that contains 16 characters,
          the last of which is an `A'.

  3.4 Often-Used Commands

   If you use sed at all, you will quite likely want to know these
   commands.

   #
          [No addresses allowed.]

          The # character begins a comment; the comment continues until
          the next newline.

          If you are concerned about portability, be aware that some
          implementations of sed (which are not posix conformant) may only
          support a single one-line comment, and then only when the very
          first character of the script is a #.

          Warning: if the first two characters of the sed script are #n,
          then the -n (no-autoprint) option is forced. If you want to put
          a comment in the first line of your script and that comment
          begins with the letter `n' and you do not want this behavior,
          then be sure to either use a capital `N', or place at least one
          space before the `n'.

   q [exit-code]
          This command only accepts a single address.

          Exit sed without processing any more commands or input. Note
          that the current pattern space is printed if auto-print is not
          disabled with the -n options. The ability to return an exit code
          from the sed script is a GNU sed extension.

   d
          Delete the pattern space; immediately start next cycle.

   p
          Print out the pattern space (to the standard output). This
          command is usually only used in conjunction with the -n
          command-line option.

   n
          If auto-print is not disabled, print the pattern space, then,
          regardless, replace the pattern space with the next line of
          input. If there is no more input then sed exits without
          processing any more commands.

   { commands }
          A group of commands may be enclosed between { and } characters.
          This is particularly useful when you want a group of commands to
          be triggered by a single address (or address-range) match.

  3.5 The s Command

   The syntax of the s (as in substitute) command is
   `s/regexp/replacement/flags'. The / characters may be uniformly
   replaced by any other single character within any given s command. The
   / character (or whatever other character is used in its stead) can
   appear in the regexp or replacement only if it is preceded by a \
   character.

   The s command is probably the most important in sed and has a lot of
   different options. Its basic concept is simple: the s command attempts
   to match the pattern space against the supplied regexp; if the match is
   successful, then that portion of the pattern space which was matched is
   replaced with replacement.

   The replacement can contain \n (n being a number from 1 to 9,
   inclusive) references, which refer to the portion of the match which is
   contained between the nth \( and its matching \). Also, the replacement
   can contain unescaped & characters which reference the whole matched
   portion of the pattern space. Finally, as a GNU sed extension, you can
   include a special sequence made of a backslash and one of the letters
   L, l, U, u, or E. The meaning is as follows:

   \L
          Turn the replacement to lowercase until a \U or \E is found,

   \l
          Turn the next character to lowercase,

   \U
          Turn the replacement to uppercase until a \L or \E is found,

   \u
          Turn the next character to uppercase,

   \E
          Stop case conversion started by \L or \U.

   To include a literal \, &, or newline in the final replacement, be sure
   to precede the desired \, &, or newline in the replacement with a \.

   The s command can be followed by zero or more of the following flags:

   g
          Apply the replacement to all matches to the regexp, not just the
          first.

   number
          Only replace the numberth match of the regexp.

          Note: the posix standard does not specify what should happen
          when you mix the g and number modifiers, and currently there is
          no widely agreed upon meaning across sed implementations. For
          GNU sed, the interaction is defined to be: ignore matches before
          the numberth, and then match and replace all matches from the
          numberth on.

   p
          If the substitution was made, then print the new pattern space.

          Note: when both the p and e options are specified, the relative
          ordering of the two produces very different results. In general,
          ep (evaluate then print) is what you want, but operating the
          other way round can be useful for debugging. For this reason,
          the current version of GNU sed interprets specially the presence
          of p options both before and after e, printing the pattern space
          before and after evaluation, while in general flags for the s
          command show their effect just once. This behavior, although
          documented, might change in future versions.

   w file-name
          If the substitution was made, then write out the result to the
          named file. As a GNU sed extension, two special values of
          file-name are supported: /dev/stderr, which writes the result to
          the standard error, and /dev/stdout, which writes to the
          standard output.^4

   e
          This command allows one to pipe input from a shell command into
          pattern space. If a substitution was made, the command that is
          found in pattern space is executed and pattern space is replaced
          with its output. A trailing newline is suppressed; results are
          undefined if the command to be executed contains a nul
          character. This is a GNU sed extension.

   I
   i
          The I modifier to regular-expression matching is a GNU extension
          which makes sed match regexp in a case-insensitive manner.

   M
   m
          The M modifier to regular-expression matching is a GNU sed
          extension which causes ^ and $ to match respectively (in
          addition to the normal behavior) the empty string after a
          newline, and the empty string before a newline. There are
          special character sequences (\` and \') which always match the
          beginning or the end of the buffer. M stands for multi-line.

  3.6 Less Frequently-Used Commands

   Though perhaps less frequently used than those in the previous section,
   some very small yet useful sed scripts can be built with these
   commands.

   y/source-chars/dest-chars/
          (The / characters may be uniformly replaced by any other single
          character within any given y command.)

          Transliterate any characters in the pattern space which match
          any of the source-chars with the corresponding character in
          dest-chars.

          Instances of the / (or whatever other character is used in its
          stead), \, or newlines can appear in the source-chars or
          dest-chars lists, provide that each instance is escaped by a \.
          The source-chars and dest-chars lists must contain the same
          number of characters (after de-escaping).

   a\
   text
          As a GNU extension, this command accepts two addresses.

          Queue the lines of text which follow this command (each but the
          last ending with a \, which are removed from the output) to be
          output at the end of the current cycle, or when the next input
          line is read.

          Escape sequences in text are processed, so you should use \\ in
          text to print a single backslash.

          As a GNU extension, if between the a and the newline there is
          other than a whitespace-\ sequence, then the text of this line,
          starting at the first non-whitespace character after the a, is
          taken as the first line of the text block. (This enables a
          simplification in scripting a one-line add.) This extension also
          works with the i and c commands.

   i\
   text
          As a GNU extension, this command accepts two addresses.

          Immediately output the lines of text which follow this command
          (each but the last ending with a \, which are removed from the
          output).

   c\
   text
          Delete the lines matching the address or address-range, and
          output the lines of text which follow this command (each but the
          last ending with a \, which are removed from the output) in
          place of the last line (or in place of each line, if no
          addresses were specified). A new cycle is started after this
          command is done, since the pattern space will have been deleted.

   =
          As a GNU extension, this command accepts two addresses.

          Print out the current input line number (with a trailing
          newline).

   l n
          Print the pattern space in an unambiguous form: non-printable
          characters (and the \ character) are printed in C-style escaped
          form; long lines are split, with a trailing \ character to
          indicate the split; the end of each line is marked with a $.

          n specifies the desired line-wrap length; a length of 0 (zero)
          means to never wrap long lines. If omitted, the default as
          specified on the command line is used. The n parameter is a GNU
          sed extension.

   r filename
          As a GNU extension, this command accepts two addresses.

          Queue the contents of filename to be read and inserted into the
          output stream at the end of the current cycle, or when the next
          input line is read. Note that if filename cannot be read, it is
          treated as if it were an empty file, without any error
          indication.

          As a GNU sed extension, the special value /dev/stdin is
          supported for the file name, which reads the contents of the
          standard input.

   w filename
          Write the pattern space to filename. As a GNU sed extension, two
          special values of file-name are supported: /dev/stderr, which
          writes the result to the standard error, and /dev/stdout, which
          writes to the standard output.^5

          The file will be created (or truncated) before the first input
          line is read; all w commands (including instances of w flag on
          successful s commands) which refer to the same filename are
          output without closing and reopening the file.

   D
          Delete text in the pattern space up to the first newline. If any
          text is left, restart cycle with the resultant pattern space
          (without reading a new line of input), otherwise start a normal
          new cycle.

   N
          Add a newline to the pattern space, then append the next line of
          input to the pattern space. If there is no more input then sed
          exits without processing any more commands.

   P
          Print out the portion of the pattern space up to the first
          newline.

   h
          Replace the contents of the hold space with the contents of the
          pattern space.

   H
          Append a newline to the contents of the hold space, and then
          append the contents of the pattern space to that of the hold
          space.

   g
          Replace the contents of the pattern space with the contents of
          the hold space.

   G
          Append a newline to the contents of the pattern space, and then
          append the contents of the hold space to that of the pattern
          space.

   x
          Exchange the contents of the hold and pattern spaces.

  3.7 Commands for sed gurus

   In most cases, use of these commands indicates that you are probably
   better off programming in something like awk or Perl. But occasionally
   one is committed to sticking with sed, and these commands can enable
   one to write quite convoluted scripts.

   : label
          [No addresses allowed.]

          Specify the location of label for branch commands. In all other
          respects, a no-op.

   b label
          Unconditionally branch to label. The label may be omitted, in
          which case the next cycle is started.

   t label
          Branch to label only if there has been a successful substitution
          since the last input line was read or conditional branch was
          taken. The label may be omitted, in which case the next cycle is
          started.
     __________________________________________________________________

  3.8 Commands Specific to GNU sed

   These commands are specific to GNU sed, so you must use them with care
   and only when you are sure that hindering portability is not evil. They
   allow you to check for GNU sed extensions or to do tasks that are
   required quite often, yet are unsupported by standard seds.

   e [command]
          This command allows one to pipe input from a shell command into
          pattern space. Without parameters, the e command executes the
          command that is found in pattern space and replaces the pattern
          space with the output; a trailing newline is suppressed.

          If a parameter is specified, instead, the e command interprets
          it as a command and sends its output to the output stream (like
          r does). The command can run across multiple lines, all but the
          last ending with a back-slash.

          In both cases, the results are undefined if the command to be
          executed contains a nul character.

   L n
          This GNU sed extension fills and joins lines in pattern space to
          produce output lines of (at most) n characters, like fmt does;
          if n is omitted, the default as specified on the command line is
          used. This command is considered a failed experiment and unless
          there is enough request (which seems unlikely) will be removed
          in future versions.

   Q [exit-code]
          This command only accepts a single address.

          This command is the same as q, but will not print the contents
          of pattern space. Like q, it provides the ability to return an
          exit code to the caller.

          This command can be useful because the only alternative ways to
          accomplish this apparently trivial function are to use the -n
          option (which can unnecessarily complicate your script) or
          resorting to the following snippet, which wastes time by reading
          the whole file without any visible effect:

          :eat
          $d       Quit silently on the last line
          N        Read another line, silently
          g        Overwrite pattern space each time to save memory
          b eat

   R filename
          Queue a line of filename to be read and inserted into the output
          stream at the end of the current cycle, or when the next input
          line is read. Note that if filename cannot be read, or if its
          end is reached, no line is appended, without any error
          indication.

          As with the r command, the special value /dev/stdin is supported
          for the file name, which reads a line from the standard input.

   T label
          Branch to label only if there have been no successful
          substitutions since the last input line was read or conditional
          branch was taken. The label may be omitted, in which case the
          next cycle is started.

   v version
          This command does nothing, but makes sed fail if GNU sed
          extensions are not supported, simply because other versions of
          sed do not implement it. In addition, you can specify the
          version of sed that your script requires, such as 4.0.5. The
          default is 4.0 because that is the first version that
          implemented this command.

          This command enables all GNU extensions even if POSIXLY_CORRECT
          is set in the environment.

   W filename
          Write to the given filename the portion of the pattern space up
          to the first newline. Everything said under the w command about
          file handling holds here too.

  3.9 GNU Extensions for Escapes in Regular Expressions

   Until this chapter, we have only encountered escapes of the form `\^',
   which tell sed not to interpret the circumflex as a special character,
   but rather to take it literally. For example, `\*' matches a single
   asterisk rather than zero or more backslashes.

   This chapter introduces another kind of escape^6—that is, escapes that
   are applied to a character or sequence of characters that ordinarily
   are taken literally, and that sed replaces with a special character.
   This provides a way of encoding non-printable characters in patterns in
   a visible manner. There is no restriction on the appearance of
   non-printing characters in a sed script but when a script is being
   prepared in the shell or by text editing, it is usually easier to use
   one of the following escape sequences than the binary character it
   represents:

   The list of these escapes is:

   \a
          Produces or matches a bel character, that is an “alert” (ascii
          7).

   \f
          Produces or matches a form feed (ascii 12).

   \n
          Produces or matches a newline (ascii 10).

   \r
          Produces or matches a carriage return (ascii 13).

   \t
          Produces or matches a horizontal tab (ascii 9).

   \v
          Produces or matches a so called “vertical tab” (ascii 11).

   \cx
          Produces or matches Control-x, where x is any character. The
          precise effect of `\cx' is as follows: if x is a lower case
          letter, it is converted to upper case. Then bit 6 of the
          character (hex 40) is inverted. Thus `\cz' becomes hex 1A, but
          `\c{' becomes hex 3B, while `\c;' becomes hex 7B.

   \dxxx
          Produces or matches a character whose decimal ascii value is
          xxx.

   \oxxx
          Produces or matches a character whose octal ascii value is xxx.

   \xxx
          Produces or matches a character whose hexadecimal ascii value is
          xx.

   `\b' (backspace) was omitted because of the conflict with the existing
   “word boundary” meaning.

   Other escapes match a particular character class and are valid only in
   regular expressions:

   \w
          Matches any “word” character. A “word” character is any letter
          or digit or the underscore character.

   \W
          Matches any “non-word” character.

   \b
          Matches a word boundary; that is it matches if the character to
          the left is a “word” character and the character to the right is
          a “non-word” character, or vice-versa.

   \B
          Matches everywhere but on a word boundary; that is it matches if
          the character to the left and the character to the right are
          either both “word” characters or both “non-word” characters.

   \`
          Matches only at the start of pattern space. This is different
          from ^ in multi-line mode.

   \'
          Matches only at the end of pattern space. This is different from
          $ in multi-line mode.

4 Some Sample Scripts

   Here are some sed scripts to guide you in the art of mastering sed.

   Some exotic examples:
     * Centering lines
     * Increment a number
     * Rename files to lower case
     * Print bash environment
     * Reverse chars of lines

   Emulating standard utilities:
     * tac: Reverse lines of files
     * cat -n: Numbering lines
     * cat -b: Numbering non-blank lines
     * wc -c: Counting chars
     * wc -w: Counting words
     * wc -l: Counting lines
     * head: Printing the first lines
     * tail: Printing the last lines
     * uniq: Make duplicate lines unique
     * uniq -d: Print duplicated lines of input
     * uniq -u: Remove all duplicated lines
     * cat -s: Squeezing blank lines
     __________________________________________________________________

   Next: Increment a number, Up: Examples

  4.1 Centering Lines

   This script centers all lines of a file on a 80 columns width. To
   change that width, the number in \{...\} must be replaced, and the
   number of added spaces also must be changed.

   Note how the buffer commands are used to separate parts in the regular
   expressions to be matched—this is a common technique.
     #!/usr/bin/sed -f

     # Put 80 spaces in the buffer
     1 {
       x
       s/^$/          /
       s/^.*$/&&&&&&&&/
       x
     }

     # del leading and trailing spaces
     y/tab/ /
     s/^ *//
     s/ *$//

     # add a newline and 80 spaces to end of line
     G

     # keep first 81 chars (80 + a newline)
     s/^\(.\{81\}\).*$/\1/

     # \2 matches half of the spaces, which are moved to the beginning
     s/^\(.*\)\n\(.*\)\2/\2\1/

  4.2 Increment a Number

   This script is one of a few that demonstrate how to do arithmetic in
   sed. This is indeed possible,^7 but must be done manually.

   To increment one number you just add 1 to last digit, replacing it by
   the following digit. There is one exception: when the digit is a nine
   the previous digits must be also incremented until you don't have a
   nine.

   This solution by Bruno Haible is very clever and smart because it uses
   a single buffer; if you don't have this limitation, the algorithm used
   in Numbering lines, is faster. It works by replacing trailing nines
   with an underscore, then using multiple s commands to increment the
   last digit, and then again substituting underscores with zeros.
     #!/usr/bin/sed -f

     /[^0-9]/ d

     # replace all leading 9s by _ (any other character except digits, could
     # be used)
     :d
     s/9\(_*\)$/_\1/
     td

     # incr last digit only.  The first line adds a most-significant
     # digit of 1 if we have to add a digit.
     #
     # The tn commands are not necessary, but make the thing
     # faster

     s/^\(_*\)$/1\1/; tn
     s/8\(_*\)$/9\1/; tn
     s/7\(_*\)$/8\1/; tn

  4.3 Rename Files to Lower Case

   This is a pretty strange use of sed. We transform text, and transform
   it to be shell commands, then just feed them to shell. Don't worry,
   even worse hacks are done when using sed; I have seen a script
   converting the output of date into a bc program!

   The main body of this is the sed script, which remaps the name from
   lower to upper (or vice-versa) and even checks out if the remapped name
   is the same as the original name. Note how the script is parameterized
   using shell variables and proper quoting.
     #! /bin/sh
     # rename files to lower/upper case...
     #
     # usage:
     #    move-to-lower *
     #    move-to-upper *
     # or
     #    move-to-lower -R .
     #    move-to-upper -R .
     #

  4.5 Reverse Characters of Lines

   This script can be used to reverse the position of characters in lines.
   The technique moves two characters at a time, hence it is faster than
   more intuitive implementations.

   Note the tx command before the definition of the label. This is often
   needed to reset the flag that is tested by the t command.

   Imaginative readers will find uses for this script. An example is
   reversing the output of banner.^8
     #!/usr/bin/sed -f

     /../! b

     # Reverse a line.  Begin embedding the line between two newlines
     s/^.*$/\
     &\
     /

     # Move first character at the end.  The regexp matches until
     # there are zero or one characters between the markers
     tx
     :x
     s/\(\n.\)\(.*\)\(.\n\)/\3\2\1/
     tx

  4.6 Reverse Lines of Files

   This one begins a series of totally useless (yet interesting) scripts
   emulating various Unix commands. This, in particular, is a tac
   workalike.

   Note that on implementations other than GNU sed this script might
   easily overflow internal buffers.
     #!/usr/bin/sed -nf

     # reverse all lines of input, i.e. first line became last, ...

     # from the second line, the buffer (which contains all previous lines)
     # is *appended* to current line, so, the order will be reversed
     1! G

     # on the last line we're done -- print everything
     $ p

     # store everything on the buffer again
     h
     __________________________________________________________________

   Next: cat -b, Previous: tac, Up: Examples

  4.7 Numbering Lines

   This script replaces `cat -n'; in fact it formats its output exactly
   like GNU cat does.

   Of course this is completely useless and for two reasons: first,
   because somebody else did it in C, second, because the following
   Bourne-shell script could be used for the same purpose and would be
   much faster:
     #! /bin/sh
     sed -e "=" $@ | sed -e '
       s/^/      /
       N
       s/^ *\(......\)\n/\1  /
     '

   It uses sed to print the line number, then groups lines two by two
   using N. Of course, this script does not teach as much as the one
   presented below.

   The algorithm used for incrementing uses both buffers, so the line is
   printed as soon as possible and then discarded. The number is split so
   that changing digits go in a buffer and unchanged ones go in the other;
   the changed digits are modified in a single step (using a y command).
   The line number for the next line is then composed and stored in the
   hold space, to be used in the next iteration.
     #!/usr/bin/sed -nf

     # Prime the pump on the first line
     x
     /^$/ s/^.*$/1/

     # Add the correct line number before the pattern
     G
     h

     # Format it and print it
     s/^/      /
     s/^ *\(......\)\n/\1  /p

     # Get the line number from hold space; add a zero
     # if we're going to add a digit on the next line
     g
     s/\n.*$//
     /^9*$/ s/^/0/

     # separate changing/unchanged digits with an x
     s/.9*$/x&/

     # keep changing digits in hold space
     h
     s/^.*x//
     y/0123456789/1234567890/
     x

     # keep unchanged digits in pattern space
     s/x.*$//

     # compose the new number, remove the newline implicitly added by G
     G

  4.9 Counting Characters

   This script shows another way to do arithmetic with sed. In this case
   we have to add possibly large numbers, so implementing this by
   successive increments would not be feasible (and possibly even more
   complicated to contrive than this script).

   The approach is to map numbers to letters, kind of an abacus
   implemented with sed. `a's are units, `b's are tens and so on: we
   simply add the number of characters on the current line as units, and
   then propagate the carry to tens, hundreds, and so on.

   As usual, running totals are kept in hold space.

   On the last line, we convert the abacus form back to decimal. For the
   sake of variety, this is done with a loop rather than with some 80 s
   commands^9: first we convert units, removing `a's from the number; then
   we rotate letters so that tens become `a's, and so on until no more
   letters remain.
     #!/usr/bin/sed -nf

     # Add n+1 a's to hold space (+1 is for the newline)
     s/./a/g
     H
     x
     s/\n/a/

     # Do the carry.  The t's and b's are not necessary,
     # but they do speed up the thing
     t a
     : a;  s/aaaaaaaaaa/b/g; t b; b done
     : b;  s/bbbbbbbbbb/c/g; t c; b done
     : c;  s/cccccccccc/d/g; t d; b done
     : d;  s/dddddddddd/e/g; t e; b done
     : e;  s/eeeeeeeeee/f/g; t f; b done

     : h;  s/hhhhhhhhhh//g

     : done
     $! {
       h
       b
     }

     # On the last line, convert back to decimal

     : loop
     /a/! s/[b-h]*/&0/
     s/aaaaaaaaa/9/
     s/aaaaaaaa/8/
     s/aaaaaaa/7/
     s/aaaaaa/6/
     s/aaaaa/5/

  4.10 Counting Words

   This script is almost the same as the previous one, once each of the
   words on the line is converted to a single `a' (in the previous script
   each letter was changed to an `a').

   It is interesting that real wc programs have optimized loops for `wc
   -c', so they are much slower at counting words rather than characters.
   This script's bottleneck, instead, is arithmetic, and hence the
   word-counting one is faster (it has to manage smaller numbers).

   Again, the common parts are not commented to show the importance of
   commenting sed scripts.
     #!/usr/bin/sed -nf

     # Convert words to a's
     s/[ tab][ tab]*/ /g
     s/^/ /
     s/ [^ ][^ ]*/a /g
     s/ //g

     # Append them to hold space
     H
     x
     s/\n//

     # From here on it is the same as in wc -c.
     /aaaaaaaaaa/! bx;   s/aaaaaaaaaa/b/g
     /bbbbbbbbbb/! bx;   s/bbbbbbbbbb/c/g
     /cccccccccc/! bx;   s/cccccccccc/d/g
     /dddddddddd/! bx;   s/dddddddddd/e/g
     /eeeeeeeeee/! bx;   s/eeeeeeeeee/f/g

  4.11 Counting Lines

     $=
     __________________________________________________________________

   Next: tail, Previous: wc -l, Up: Examples

  4.12 Printing the First Lines

   This script is probably the simplest useful sed script. It displays the
   first 10 lines of input; the number of displayed lines is right before
   the q command.
     #!/usr/bin/sed -f
     10q
     __________________________________________________________________

   Next: uniq, Previous: head, Up: Examples

  4.13 Printing the Last Lines

   Printing the last n lines rather than the first is more complex but
   indeed possible. n is encoded in the second line, before the bang
   character.

   This script is similar to the tac script in that it keeps the final
   output in the hold space and prints it at the end:
     #!/usr/bin/sed -nf

     1! {; H; g; }
     1,10 !s/[^\n]*\n//
     $p
     h

   Mainly, the scripts keeps a window of 10 lines and slides it by adding
   a line and deleting the oldest (the substitution command on the second
   line works like a D command but does not restart the loop).

   The “sliding window” technique is a very powerful way to write
   efficient and complex sed scripts, because commands like P would
   require a lot of work if implemented manually.

   To introduce the technique, which is fully demonstrated in the rest of
   this chapter and is based on the N, P and D commands, here is an
   implementation of tail using a simple “sliding window.”

   This looks complicated but in fact the working is the same as the last
   script: after we have kicked in the appropriate number of lines,
   however, we stop using the hold space to keep inter-line state, and
   instead use N and D to slide pattern space by one line:
     #!/usr/bin/sed -f

     1h
     2,10 {; H; g; }
     $q
     1,9d
     N
     D

   Note how the first, second and fourth line are inactive after the first
   ten lines of input. After that, all the script does is: exiting on the
   last line of input, appending the next input line to pattern space, and
   removing the first line.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Next: uniq -d, Previous: tail, Up: Examples

  4.14 Make Duplicate Lines Unique

   This is an example of the art of using the N, P and D commands,
   probably the most difficult to master.
     #!/usr/bin/sed -f
     h

     :b
     # On the last line, print and exit
     $b
     N
     /^\(.*\)\n\1$/ {
         # The two lines are identical.  Undo the effect of
         # the n command.
         g
         bb
     }

     # If the N command had added the last line, print and exit
     $b

     # The lines are different; print the first and go
     # back working on the second.
     P
     D

   As you can see, we mantain a 2-line window using P and D. This
   technique is often used in advanced sed scripts.

  4.17 Squeezing Blank Lines

   As a final example, here are three scripts, of increasing complexity
   and speed, that implement the same function as `cat -s', that is
   squeezing blank lines.

   The first leaves a blank line at the beginning and end if there are
   some already.
     #!/usr/bin/sed -f

     # on empty lines, join with next
     # Note there is a star in the regexp
     :x
     /^\n*$/ {
     N
     bx
     }

     # now, squeeze all '\n', this can be also done by:
     # s/^\(\n\)*/\1/
     s/\n*/\
     /

   This one is a bit more complex and removes all empty lines at the
   beginning. It does leave a single blank line at end if one was there.
     #!/usr/bin/sed -f

     # delete all leading empty lines
     1,/^./{
     /./!d
     }

     # on an empty line we remove it and all the following
     # empty lines, but one
     :x
     /./!{
     N
     s/^\n$//
     tx
     }

   This removes leading and trailing blank lines. It is also the fastest.
   Note that loops are completely done with n and b, without relying on
   sed to restart the the script automatically at the end of a line.
     #!/usr/bin/sed -nf

     # delete all (leading) blanks
     /./!d

     # get here: so there is a non empty
     :x
     # print it
     p
     # get next
     n
     # got chars? print it again, etc...
     /./bx

     # no, don't have chars: got an empty line
     :z
     # get next, if last line we finish here so no trailing
     # empty lines are written
     n
     # also empty? then ignore it, and get next... this will
     # remove ALL empty lines
     /./!bz

     # all empty lines were deleted/ignored, but we have a non empty.  As
     # what we want to do is to squeeze, insert a blank line artificially

5 GNU sed's Limitations and Non-limitations

   For those who want to write portable sed scripts, be aware that some
   implementations have been known to limit line lengths (for the pattern
   and hold spaces) to be no more than 4000 bytes. The posix standard
   specifies that conforming sed implementations shall support at least
   8192 byte line lengths. GNU sed has no built-in limit on line length;
   as long as it can malloc() more (virtual) memory, you can feed or
   construct lines as long as you like.

   However, recursion is used to handle subpatterns and indefinite
   repetition. This means that the available stack space may limit the
   size of the buffer that can be processed by certain patterns.

7 Reporting Bugs

   Email bug reports to bonzini@gnu.org. Be sure to include the word “sed”
   somewhere in the Subject: field. Also, please include the output of
   `sed --version' in the body of your report if at all possible.

   Please do not send a bug report like this:
     while building frobme-1.3.4

     error--> sed: file sedscr line 1: Unknown option to 's'

   If GNU sed doesn't configure your favorite package, take a few extra
   minutes to identify the specific problem and make a stand-alone test
   case. Unlike other programs such as C compilers, making such test cases
   for sed is quite simple.

   A stand-alone test case includes all the data necessary to perform the
   test, and the specific invocation of sed that causes the problem. The
   smaller a stand-alone test case is, the better. A test case should not
   involve something as far removed from sed as “try to configure
   frobme-1.3.4”. Yes, that is in principle enough information to look for
   the bug, but that is not a very practical prospect.

   Here are a few commonly reported bugs that are not bugs.

   N command on the last line
          Most versions of sed exit without printing anything when the N
          command is issued on the last line of a file. GNU sed prints
          pattern space before exiting unless of course the -n command
          switch has been specified. This choice is by design.

          For example, the behavior of

          sed N foo bar

          would depend on whether foo has an even or an odd number of
          lines^10. Or, when writing a script to read the next few lines
          following a pattern match, traditional implementations of sed
          would force you to write something like

          /foo/{ $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N; $!N }

          instead of just

          /foo/{ N;N;N;N;N;N;N;N;N; }

          In any case, the simplest workaround is to use $d;N in scripts
          that rely on the traditional behavior, or to set the
          POSIXLY_CORRECT variable to a non-empty value.

   Regex syntax clashes (problems with backslashes)
          sed uses the posix basic regular expression syntax. According to
          the standard, the meaning of some escape sequences is undefined
          in this syntax; notable in the case of sed are \|, \+, \?, \`,
          \', \<, \>, \b, \B, \w, and \W.

          As in all GNU programs that use posix basic regular expressions,
          sed interprets these escape sequences as special characters. So,
          x\+ matches one or more occurrences of `x'. abc\|def matches
          either `abc' or `def'.

          This syntax may cause problems when running scripts written for
          other seds. Some sed programs have been written with the
          assumption that \| and \+ match the literal characters | and +.
          Such scripts must be modified by removing the spurious
          backslashes if they are to be used with modern implementations
          of sed, like GNU sed.

          On the other hand, some scripts use s|abc\|def||g to remove
          occurrences of either abc or def. While this worked until sed
          4.0.x, newer versions interpret this as removing the string
          abc|def. This is again undefined behavior according to POSIX,
          and this interpretation is arguably more robust: older seds, for
          example, required that the regex matcher parsed \/ as / in the
          common case of escaping a slash, which is again undefined
          behavior; the new behavior avoids this, and this is good because
          the regex matcher is only partially under our control.

          In addition, this version of sed supports several escape
          characters (some of which are multi-character) to insert
          non-printable characters in scripts (\a, \c, \d, \o, \r, \t, \v,
          \x). These can cause similar problems with scripts written for
          other seds.

   -i clobbers read-only files
          In short, `sed -i' will let you delete the contents of a
          read-only file, and in general the -i option (see Invocation)
          lets you clobber protected files. This is not a bug, but rather
          a consequence of how the Unix filesystem works.

          The permissions on a file say what can happen to the data in
          that file, while the permissions on a directory say what can
          happen to the list of files in that directory. `sed -i' will not
          ever open for writing a file that is already on disk. Rather, it
          will work on a temporary file that is finally renamed to the
          original name: if you rename or delete files, you're actually
          modifying the contents of the directory, so the operation
          depends on the permissions of the directory, not of the file.
          For this same reason, sed does not let you use -i on a writeable
          file in a read-only directory, and will break hard or symbolic
          links when -i is used on such a file.

   0a does not work (gives an error)
          There is no line 0. 0 is a special address that is only used to
          treat addresses like 0,/RE/ as active when the script starts: if
          you write 1,/abc/d and the first line includes the word `abc',
          then that match would be ignored because address ranges must
          span at least two lines (barring the end of the file); but what
          you probably wanted is to delete every line up to the first one
          including `abc', and this is obtained with 0,/abc/d.

   [a-z] is case insensitive
          You are encountering problems with locales. POSIX mandates that
          [a-z] uses the current locale's collation order – in C parlance,
          that means using strcoll(3) instead of strcmp(3). Some locales
          have a case-insensitive collation order, others don't.

          Another problem is that [a-z] tries to use collation symbols.
          This only happens if you are on the GNU system, using GNU libc's
          regular expression matcher instead of compiling the one supplied
          with GNU sed. In a Danish locale, for example, the regular
          expression ^[a-z]$ matches the string `aa', because this is a
          single collating symbol that comes after `a' and before `b';
          `ll' behaves similarly in Spanish locales, or `ij' in Dutch
          locales.

          To work around these problems, which may cause bugs in shell
          scripts, set the LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE environment variables
          to `C'.

Appendix A Extended regular expressions

   The only difference between basic and extended regular expressions is
   in the behavior of a few characters: `?', `+', parentheses, and braces
   (`{}'). While basic regular expressions require these to be escaped if
   you want them to behave as special characters, when using extended
   regular expressions you must escape them if you want them to match a
   literal character.

   Examples:

   abc?
          becomes `abc\?' when using extended regular expressions. It
          matches the literal string `abc?'.

   c\+
          becomes `c+' when using extended regular expressions. It matches
          one or more `c's.

   a\{3,\}
          becomes `a{3,}' when using extended regular expressions. It
          matches three or more `a's.

   \(abc\)\{2,3\}
          becomes `(abc){2,3}' when using extended regular expressions. It
          matches either `abcabc' or `abcabcabc'.

   \(abc*\)\1
          becomes `(abc*)\1' when using extended regular expressions.
          Backreferences must still be escaped when using extended regular
          expressions.

Footnotes

   [1] This applies to commands such as =, a, c, i, l, p. You can still
   write to the standard output by using the w or W commands together with
   the /dev/stdout special file

   [2] Note that GNU sed creates the backup file whether or not any output
   is actually changed.

   [3] Actually, if sed prints a line without the terminating newline, it
   will nevertheless print the missing newline as soon as more text is
   sent to the same output stream, which gives the “least expected
   surprise” even though it does not make commands like `sed -n p' exactly
   identical to cat.

   [4] This is equivalent to p unless the -i option is being used.

   [5] This is equivalent to p unless the -i option is being used.

   [6] All the escapes introduced here are GNU extensions, with the
   exception of \n. In basic regular expression mode, setting
   POSIXLY_CORRECT disables them inside bracket expressions.

   [7] sed guru Greg Ubben wrote an implementation of the dc rpn
   calculator! It is distributed together with sed.

   [8] This requires another script to pad the output of banner; for
   example
     #! /bin/sh

     banner -w $1 $2 $3 $4 |
       sed -e :a -e '/^.\{0,'$1'\}$/ { s/$/ /; ba; }' |
       ~/sedscripts/reverseline.sed

   [9] Some implementations have a limit of 199 commands per script

   [10] which is the actual “bug” that prompted the change in behavior
