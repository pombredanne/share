////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** A self-extracting archive (SFX) is a computer application which contains a file archive, as well as programming to extract this information. Such file archives do not require a second executable file or program to extract from the archive, as archive files usually require.
** The original purpose for the self-extracting archive was to allow the distribution of tools for extracting (and adding) member files to an archive file. The situation otherwise, in effect, represents a "chicken and egg" problem: in order to use an archive file, the user requires a de-archiver program, which they have to be able to get onto their computer. 沒錯，這是個 "雞生蛋、蛋生雞" 的問題。
** The main downside of self-extracting archives is that running executables downloaded from the Internet may pose a security risk. With a regular archive, one could open it with an unarchiver without running any foreign code. However, with an executable, it is not possible to clearly verify whether an archive contains a malicious program. 要看 SFX 的內容應該不是問題，但有什麼工具可以看出解開後會自動執行什麼??
** Another issue with self-extracting archives is that they are platform-specific. For example, a self-extracting archive for Windows will not run on Mac OS X.
