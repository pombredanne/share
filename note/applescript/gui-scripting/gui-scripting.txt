////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** While creating scripting workflows, you may occasionally need to control applications that either do not have AppleScript support or are only partially scriptable. Mac OS X includes built-in support for the control of the computer's graphic user interface via AppleScript. 如果是 scriptable application，就儘量用 language interface，否則才從 GUI 下手。
** Graphic User interface (GUI) control is performed by writing scripts incorporating terms and commands from the "Processes Suite in the System Events" application's scripting dictionary. By addressing the System Events application, AppleScript scripts can select menu items, push buttons, enter text into text fields, and generally control the interfaces of many applications.
** The GUI Scripting architecture is based upon the Mac OS X Accessibility Frameworks that provide alternative methods of querying and controlling the interfaces of the OS and applications. By default, the Accessibility Frameworks are disabled. They are enabled by clicking the checkbox labeled "Enable access for assistive devices" in the Universal Access System Preference pane. (System Preferences > Accessibility)
** Scripted actions are performed by addressing the System Events application which has a special script suite (Processes Suite) for communicating with the GUI Scripting architecture.
** `set UI_enabled to UI elements enabled` -- 查詢 accessibility 有沒有 enabled
** `set current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.universalaccess"` -- `pane id` 的用法是 System Preferences 特有的。
** `tell process "System Preferences"` -- 為什麼 process 這麼像 application name??
