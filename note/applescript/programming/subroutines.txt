** sorting lists of names or parsing HTML files.
** Sub-routines exist in scripts as sections of specialized AppleScript code placed "at the end" of your scripts. They are named and function as commands which can be evoked from anywhere within your script. 為什麼一定要擺後面??
** The sub-routine name is then preceded by the word "on" and followed by an open and close parens. This is the opening part of the sub-routine handler and is placed before the section of AppleScript code we wish to identify as a sub-routine. To complete the sub-routine, the code segment is followed by a closing statement which begins with the word "end" and the sub-routine name.
** Sub-routines can be called from anywhere within a script. To call a sub-routine, just place the sub-routine name and its following parens on a line in the script. 就算沒有參數，也要加括號。
** There is one special requirement for evoking a sub-routine within a tell block: it must be preceded by the word "my". Doing so identifies to the script that the sub-routine name belongs to the script and not to the object targeted by the tell block.
** Sub-routines can receive information passed to them from the script. The passed information can alter the way the sub-routine works or be data that the sub-routine processes and returns to the script.
** Notice that there is now a variable within the parens: threshold_percentage. This variable will contain the information passed to the sub-routine.
** Notice that when the sub-routine is called from within the script, a numeric value is placed within the parens to be passed to sub-routine.
** Often sub-routines are used to process passed information and return the result back to the script. To enable this functionality, place in your sub-routine the return command followed by the value to return to the script.
