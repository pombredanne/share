   Selenium IDE is an integrated development environment for Selenium
   scripts. It is implemented as a Firefox extension, and allows you to
   record, edit, and debug tests. Selenium IDE includes the entire
   Selenium Core, allowing you to easily and quickly record and play back
   tests in the actual environment that they will run.

   Selenium IDE is not only recording tool: it is a complete IDE. You can
   choose to use its recording capability, or you may edit your scripts by
   hand. With autocomplete support and the ability to move commands around
   quickly, Selenium IDE is the ideal environment for creating Selenium
   tests no matter what style of tests you prefer.

Features:

     * Easy record and playback
     * Intelligent field selection will use IDs, names, or XPath as needed
     * Autocomplete for all common Selenium commands
     * Walk through tests
     * Debug and set breakpoints
     * Save tests as HTML, Ruby scripts, or any other format
     * Support for Selenium user-extensions.js file
     * Option to automatically assert the title of every page
     * NEW! Easy customization through plugins
