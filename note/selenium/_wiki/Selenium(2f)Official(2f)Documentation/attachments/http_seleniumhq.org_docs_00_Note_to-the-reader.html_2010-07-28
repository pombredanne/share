   Introducing Selenium

Note to the Reader??

   Hello, and welcome to Selenium! The Documentation Team would like to
   welcome you, and to thank you for being interested in Selenium.

   We have worked very, very hard on this document. Why? We absolutely
   believe this is the best tool for web-application testing. We feel its
   extensibility and flexibility, along with its tight integration with
   the browser, is unmatched by available proprietary tools. We are very
   excited to promote Selenium and, hopefully, to expand its user
   community. In short, we really want to “get the word out” about
   Selenium.

   We truly believe you will be similarly excited once you learn how
   Selenium approaches test automation. It’s quite different from other
   tools. Whether you are brand-new to Selenium, or have been using it for
   awhile, we believe this documentation will truly help to spread the
   knowledge around. Also, we have aimed to write so that those completely
   new to test automation will be able to use this document as a stepping
   stone. No doubt, experienced users and “newbies” will benefit from our
   Selenium User’s Guide.

   Please realize that this document is a work in progress. There are
   planned areas we haven’t written yet. However, we have written the
   beginning chapters first so newcomers can get started more smoothly. We
   have also already added some valuable information that more experienced
   users will appreciate. This document will be a ‘live’ document on the
   SeleniumHQ website where frequent updates will occur as we complete the
   additional planned documentation. We really want to hear about any
   problems you have with the documentation, or suggestions you have for
   improving it. For errors, please file a bug report. Improvement
   suggestions should be filed as an enhancement request.

     Thanks very much for reading.

     – the Selenium Documentation Team
