   One question which is very often asked by the AnyEdit users is: "why is
       THIS particular feature is not a part of the Eclipse platform"?
    Interestingly, many of the features previously offered by AnyEdit was
       integrated into the last Eclipse releases (like "show invisible
   characters"), or will be integrated ("compare with external file" will
       go into 3.5) but still basic Eclipse is missing the full set of
                        features offered by AnyEdit.

    In most cases AnyEdit is incredibly useful because it saves time and
      additionally prevent you get mad by long, boring and error prone
                               editing tasks.

      Here is a dozen of most popular solutions provided by AnyEdit for
                         common programming tasks...
    1. Problem:
        consider you have two big pieces of code in the same editor which
         looks pretty similar, and you wish to compare them. There is no
                build-in solution for such basic task in Eclipse.
                                    Solution:
          with AnyEdit you can just select one of the pieces, "Ctrl+C"
        (clipboard), then select the next one and choose "Compare With ->
         Clipboard" and get the Eclipse compare editor up. It allows you
              even patch you selected text from the compare editor!
    2. Problem:
       have you ever tried to compare any two opened editors together? It
          works fine if you have a small project with one folder and 10
         files. Ok, in this case you do not need to know what is Anyedit
         good for :-) But if you have 30+ projects in different working
        sets, it gets worser - you have navigate first to the first file,
       select this one, hold Ctrl key, navigate to the second file, select
        it too and then open a context menu to compare both. Usually you
       have also to unset some filters or enable/disable selected working
         sets etc, so it will never be done with less then 5-10 clicks.
                                    Solution:
        with AnyEdit, just right click inside the editor, select Compare
         With/Opened Editor -> done! Now you can compare ANY opened text
       editor with any other with just 3 clicks! The new feature is a real
       time saver - and it is even possible to compare/patch two external
                                editors together!
    3. Problem:
        have you ever tried to compare external file editor or class file
       editor with other files/editors? Just try it :-) There is NO way...
        Eclipse just don't provide any chance to do it by default. If you
       can't select editor's file in some kind of navigator, then you will
       never able to compare it in Eclipse => you have either run external
       diff tool or somehow import your external file into the workspace.
                                    Solution:
        with AnyEdit, just right click inside the editor, select Compare
           With/ and choose one from four possible actions provided by
       AnyEdit: Compare/Replace With: Clipboard/Workspace file.../External
                            file.../Opened Editor...
    4. Problem:
       large codebase with different projects which uses different coding
         tabs<->spaces styles. If you try to read/change such code, you
       preferred editor would not be able to display/maintain the existing
       style properly without AnyEdit across all this projects/files. You
         can even violate the project code guidelines by using different
                                  white space.
                                    Solution:
           with AnyEdit you just set your preferred way of maintaining
        tabs<->settings and it will automatically take care of it. If the
       AnyEdit settings are checked in together with the project code, no
              one will ever get in conflict with code style rules.
    5. Problem:
        convert many files/directories at once to a proper tabs<->spaces
                                     style.
                                    Solution:
             select the folder in Navigator and click "File->Convert
                                 tabs<->spaces".
    6. Problem:
        while jsp/html editing, you often need to enter html entities for
       special characters or, taken such html coded text, convert it back
         to the usual characters and paste it to the database table/sql
        editor. Usually you need to learn/type it all by the hand (not a
         problem if you have enough time, of course). Doing this with a
       large text or all the days is just a pain without AnyEdit, because
            usually you do not have much time and you made mistakes.
                                    Solution:
       AnyEdit does this in a seconds with no mistakes at all. Even more,
        AnyEdit can convert from/to special Unicode escape sequences and
                                 from/to Base64.
    7. Problem:
        navigate from the editor of your choice to any file or Java type,
        referenced in the text. For Java types it works fine but in Java
         editor only. For files there is no general solution at all. But
        what if you have struts xml file with referenced Java classes and
       included jsp's? Without AnyEdit you must ctrl+c the long path/type
         name, open the "Open type/Open resource" dialog box, ctrl+v the
         text to it, scroll editor down by searching for the right line.
         Sometimes you do not like to use clipboard because it contains
       important code snippet, so you must re-type the path/class name in
       dialog. How many keyboard/mouse interaction you need for this? Now
          multiply this by 10 if you are trying to navigate in a large
            JSP/Java codebase from one included file to another file.
                                    Solution:
        with AnyEdit it is just a right click on the path/type and go. It
       would even jump to the right line in the opened editor, if the line
                      information is provided in the text!
    8. Problem:
         your web/J2EE server or Ant build or custom script writes some
       logs/stack traces in the Eclipse debug console, and you would like
        to jump to the referenced file/class or line. Again, as described
        above, it requires too much user keyboard/mouse clicks to achieve
                                      this.
                                    Solution:
          with AnyEdit it is just right click on the path/type and go.
    9. Problem:
         you want to save the console content to file? You can do it by
       selecting the right part of the code, copy to clipboard, create and
       open the desired file, paste and save it. 20 clicks or more? Sure!
       Even worser: sometimes you can't even use copy&paste because output
                          is too big for the clipboard!
                                    Solution:
       Relax - AnyEdit allows you to save entire console content (or only
       the selected text) to the file with 4 clicks! It also automatically
              open the file in the editor (but only if you like!).
   10. Problem:
       you must see if source code contains tabs or spaces, because it is
        important for some programming languages or make files. It could
       break your code if you do not use the right type of white space. In
       this case you must use another (not Eclipse based editor) for such
         files, because there is no way to see the difference in Eclipse
                         3.1-3.2 (3.3 have it finally).
                                    Solution:
        with AnyEdit it is just a click on toolbar button and you see the
        differently highlighted or colored white space in your preferred
                                 Eclipse editor.
   11. Problem:
       you have a huge number of projects organized with working sets and
        you are not using CVS/SVN, but other version control system. You
       want to switch to another product version, so you usually creates a
          new workspace. In this workspace, you have manually sort and
                  organize you projects by same working sets...
                                    Solution:
          Anyedit adds File->Import/Export->Working Sets" wizards. This
         feature is similar to the new hidden gem in Eclipse 3.3 (switch
       workspace dialog has now an option to copy existing working sets).
       Import/Export working sets wizards allows you to store working set
       definitions to the file and apply them to the another workspace by
                       importing them, by just few clicks!
   12. Problem:
        on Linux printing is not (or not well) supported by SWT (only for
         newer GTK versions), but on the main toolbar there is always a
         grayed "print" button which takes your screen space. It is not
              possible to remove it, and it is completely unusable.
                                    Solution:
        AnyEdit allows to remove this button or replace it with a hidden
        "save all" button, which is much more useful on the main toolbar.
   13. Problem:
        Some compiler requires that each file has to end with a new line
         character. Because it is invisible, it is hard to keep track of
                        this especially if merging files.
                                    Solution:
        Anyedit can automatically (on save) add a new line at the end of
                                    the file.
