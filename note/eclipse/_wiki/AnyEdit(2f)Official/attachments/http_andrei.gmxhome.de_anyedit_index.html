                      AnyEdit tools plugin for Eclipse

     AnyEdit plugin adds several new tools to the context menu of text-
     based Eclipse editors, to output consoles, to Eclipse main menu and
     editor toolbar. AnyEdit contributes also Import/Export working sets
     wizards.

     What can AnyEdit do for you?

        -> AnyEdit examples -> AnyEdit preferences -> AnyEdit in action

     AnyEdit can show the withespace (tabs vs spaces) in editors and may
     use custom project settings for tab<->spaces auto-convert-on-save
     feature.

     AnyEdit can perform tabs <-> spaces convert on multiple files or
     entire directories and supports also file exclusion filter for tabs
     <-> spaces action.

     AnyEdit allows you automatically remove trailing whitespaces and/or
     perform tabs<->spaces conversion on a "save" action in all text-
     based Eclipse editors. It can automatically create a new line at the
     end of the file if the last line was not terminated by new line.

     AnyEdit adds "Save All", "Open File" and "Show whitespace in editor"
     buttons to the global Eclipse toolbar and can remove "Print" button
     from it (because it is completely useless on Linux).

     AnyEdit adds "Open File", "Open Type" and "Save to file..." actions
     to supported output consoles and "Save to file..." toolbar button to
     the Console view.

     AnyEdit adds four new context menu actions to "Compare With" and
     "Replace With" menus in both editors and files.

                                 Why AnyEdit

     "Open file" acton was inspired by refactoring of one big J2EE
     project that heavily used "included" JSP files. Some times it was
     necessary to traverse 5 nested includes to find a field declaration,
     thus 5 times open package explorer and search for the next file,
     brrr. With "Open file under cursor" this is a single click action.
     This works from Eclipse debug/Ant console too - moreover, if line
     information is included, then the right source line will be selected
     in editor!

     "Open type" acton was inspired by working with
     web.xml/weblogic.xml/*.tld/*.jsp files. You can now simply change
     from XML to the Java editor if you want to see the declaring Java
     class, without typing the Java class name in the "Open type" dialog.
     This works from the Eclipse Ant/debug console too!

     "Convert Spaces/Tabs" action set was inspired by Rahul Kuchhal's
     whitespace plugin and good old UltraEdit. The main difference is
     that my plugin doesn't change line ends while performing "spaces"
     operations. E.g. if you edit a Unix text file on Windows PC, Rahul's
     plugin automatically convert all line ends into DOS format (from
     "\n" to "\r\n") and vice versa. The same is for Mac/Unix, Mac/DOS
     text files too. This is angry for version control systems, diff
     tools etc. The trailing whitespace and/or tabs<->spaces conversion
     could be performed automatically on "save" action in nearly all text
     editors, even in editors which are not directly supported by AnyEdit
     context menu actions.

     And the rest is now just history :o)

                        Editor / Console integration

     For almost of Eclipse text editors this is done automatically. It
     works with default Eclipse Java and Text editors, with Web Tools
     from IBM, MyEclipse, SolarEclipse and Loboz JSP editors, JavaScript
     editor form Harish Kataria, EclipseColorer, ColorEditor, PHPEClipse,
     CFEclipse, CDT editors, EPIC (Perl), Zend PHP, PyDev (Python
     development environment), TRex TTCN3, Adobe Flex, Aptana Studio and
     I think with almost anyone text editor too.

     Console integration for "Save to file:" Ant, Java run / debug /
     stack trace, External tools, CVS, CDT make etc.

     Please do not hesitate to contact me if your editor/view/console is
     not supported.

                                    Usage

     For "Convert Tabs<->Spaces" actions on a single file you can
     right-click anywhere in current editor and then select preferred
     action to run. Whole editor buffer will be changed, trailing
     whitespace will be removed automatically.

     For "Convert Tabs<->Spaces" on a number of files, just select these
     files or directories in Navigator view and use "File->Convert
     Tabs<->Spaces" window menu. All selected text files and all text
     files in selected directory hierarchy would be checked out and
     "Tabs<->Spaces" would be executed on each file. This operation could
     not be undone without version control system, so be careful by using
     it. You may exclude files per project/global settings from this
     operation, using AnyEdit preferences.

     For "Convert Chars/Html/Case" actions you must select some text,
     then right-click on current selection and then select preferred
     action to run. Only the selected text will be changed.

     For "Open" actions place cursor into file/java type string and
     select preferred action to run. You can also select a part of
     file/type and then click on "Open" action. In both cases AnyEdit
     will try to determine right file/type, and if it is found, will open
     file/type in associated Eclipse editor.

     "Convert Tabs<->Spaces" actions uses tab width from AnyEdit
     Preference page to replace tabs with spaces/vice versa (except Java
     editor, which formatter preferences could be used instead).

     Note: As default, trailing whitespace will be removed automatically
     on save and while "Convert spaces/tabs" actons, but you can turn
     this behavoir off in AnyEdit preferences.

     "Open File" action uses special characters from AnyEdit Preference
     page to guess file name/path under cursor. It uses the simply string
     search for a continuous character sequence with allowed/required in
     path characters. Found character sequence can be the full file path
     or only one part of them, therefore plugin will search for this
     character sequence first relative to current document and if nothing
     found, in entire project/workspace and then on local file system.

     Import/Export working sets wizards allows you to store working set
     definitions to the file and apply them to the another workspace by
     importing them. This is especially useful when working on big
     workspaces containing same set of projects (each workspace
     represents just different product version or branch). Please first
     import projects into the workspace, and then working sets, otherwise
     working sets would be imported but empty.

     Note: only working set descriptions would be imported/exported, and
     not the resources included in the working sets.

     Please also read the FAQ, examples, preferences and AnyEdit in
     action!

                                   History

     New in version 2.3.0 (Eclipse 3.3-3.5 only) [04.10.2009]
     * Note: from this version plugin license has been changed from BSD to
                                 the EPL v. 1.0.
      * Feature: Added a configurable line separator for "Open file under
        cursor" to jump to line. (Based on the patch from Martin Stumpf).
     * Fixed two requests (issue 8 and issue 9) to allow better packaging
                 the plugin into the Fedora Linux distribution.

     New in version 2.2.0 (Eclipse 3.3-3.5 only) [26.04.2009]

     This is a major version change. Please do not hesitate to report any
     issues you found.

     Main driver is the technical change of the way how AnyEdit
     contributes to the Eclipse context menu. AnyEdit behavior is changed
     from dedicated contribution to some well known editors/consoles to
     the global contribution to all text editors/consoles (with some
     filtering).
        * Most of existing text editors / consoles are now supported by
                             default (I guess 99%).
     * I can't test ALL previously supported editors, so some of them can
       be not supported anymore. My guess is that this can happen only for
        some very poor coded plugins, so just don't care in this case ;-)
     * Added preference to hide "Open Type" menu entry (if you do not use
              JDT, why you should be bothered by this menu entry?)
     * Bugfix: NoClassDefFoundError on "Open Type" action with Eclipse 3.5

     Here you can see older versions history
