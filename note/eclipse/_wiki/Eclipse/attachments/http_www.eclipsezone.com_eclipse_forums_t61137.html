Using Scrapbook Pages

At 6:28 PM on Jan 8, 2006, [48]João Almeida Javalobby Newcomers wrote:

          One of the most undervalued and forgotten features of Eclipse is
          the scrapbook page , which allows to execute Java expressions
          without having to create a new Java program. This is a neat way
          to quickly test an existing class or evaluate a code snippet.

          To create a scrapbook page choose File -> New -> Other -> Java
          -> Java Run/Debug -> Scrapbook Page , choose a name and
          destination folder and thats it. Now theres an empty page where
          regular Java expressions can be written and evaluated, to do so
          just select the expression and choose one of the available
          operations (either in the toolbar now available or the context
          menu).

          Try this: write new java.util.Date() , select the text and click
          Display or Inspect .

          Display will evaluate the expression and print the result
          directly on the scrapbook, basically the return of a toString()
          applied to that object or the return value of the selected Java
          method.

          If the information displayed is not enough, theres the Inspect
          feature (see below) which shows an debug window with all the
          details of the selected object, and all this happens without
          executing any code or switching to the Debug perspective.

          [inspect.png]

          To evaluate code snippets theres the Execute feature, this will
          execute a block of code, just like in a regular java program. A
          quick way to try this is to send something to the standard
          output: just write System.out.println("Scrapbook example") ,
          select the text and hit Run , this should print something on the
          Console window (see below).

          [run.png]

          Because it's created within a Java project a scrapbook page ,
          all the classpath libraries and projects references can be used
          here; another nice feature is having code assist, just like in a
          regular Java editor page. In a scrapbook page the class names
          fully qualified, theres no, this isnt much of a problem because
          the code completion handles this nicely, but if youre working
          with unusually large class names you can check the Set Imports
          option, this will open new window where all the import
          expressions can be inserted (just the import section of a
          regular class file).

          A scrapbook page is not as fully featured as the Java editor,
          theres no outline and the code assist is somehow limited, but is
          not meant to be like that; the idea is working with just a few
          lines, and this where the scrapbook page can be useful: to
          quickly test Java expressions and code blocks present in a
          project in this kind of sandbox.

Re: Using Scrapbook Pages

          It's nice, but four things have always bugged me about Scrapbook
          pages:
          1) It requires a file to be saved. Not optional; you have to
          create a file for this to be opened. I'm guessing that's part of
          the Editor framework.
          2) Any exceptions/output you get in the Scrapbook page are
          directly pasted into your code. Why not use a dialog? Or even
          the console? Or another output box? Instead, you are forever
          having to cut out the rubbish that it inserted from last time
          (usually complaining about a missing semi-colon, which is mostly
          the cause of an error message complaining about a missing
          semi-colon being there from last time ...)
          3) Why do you have to select text to evaluate it? If I have no
          text selected, then why not guess I want to run the whole lot?
          4) Why do I have to decide in advance if I want to run, display,
          or inspect the result? Why not just one 'Run' button, and
          display the result as text (but allow me to double-click to open
          the inspector).
          It's really nice, underused, and has been around since the days
          of Visual Age. But these problems have also been around since
          then too :-(

Re: Using Scrapbook Pages

          Having to save the scrapbook is a bit annoying, but it's a minor
          problem.
          But I totally agree with you, the scrapbook editor is somehow
          limited, I can even remember a small but huge problem: no
          undo/redo.
          I haven't used Visual Age that much, but scrapbook pages are
          almost like it was when I started using eclipse (when 2.0 came
          out). Probably one of the reasons for this lack of development
          is the fear that it may overlap unit testing, I can see a newbie
          using a fully featured scrapbook for testing all his
          application.
          Even so, I think the scrapbook is useful as it is right now, for
          quick and small tests; but yes, it could be much more useful and
          there are some issues to be solved.
          Lets see if there's further development in future versions of
          Eclipse.

Re: Using Scrapbook Pages

          True, but if you raise them, and they're marked as 'Resolve
          later' in 2003 then it's pretty likely that they won't get fixed
          that way either any time soon.
          [78]https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=30151
          IMNSHO when bugs get marked as 'resolve later' it means
          'completely forget about them'. Granted, they may not make it
          into the given release at the time (in this case, 2.1) but they
          very rarely get re-opened after the fact, even when there's a
          reasonable chance that it could be put in with relatively minor
          effort.
          This has also come up in the recent 3.2 builds; there's a new
          Code Clean wizard which does things like remove methods; but
          what people have been asking for for much longer is doing
          formatting before save. That's been around since 2.0; and in one
          of the (duplicated) bugs, there's even a patch that implements
          this functionality.
          [79]https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=6749
          What's worse, you can't even report a new bug, as it just gets
          closed as a duplicate of the 'resolve later' bug.
          Frankly, reporting feature enhancements seem to really only make
          sense after the major milestone (in this case, Calliso). That
          way, there's a slim chance that they'll still be open in time
          for the planning stages for the next release. If they're
          reported pretty much any time after the first couple of
          milestones, they just get automatically shelved for good.
          Eclipse Platform 2.0: 312 bugs as 'resolve later'
          Eclipse Platform 2.1: 201 bugs as 'resolve later'
          Eclipse Platform 3.0: 410 bugs as 'resolve later'
          Eclipse Platform 3.1: 284 bugs as 'resolve later'
          (and that's just the Platform bugs; not including JDT!)
          Including my favourite:
          "WFT: Error dialog is bigger than my kitten"

Re: Using Scrapbook Pages

          They don't quite get shelved for good but I've complained about
          that too. The best thing that I've found to work is for each one
          I still care about, I add a comment asking if it's going to be
          done anytime soon. That will get it back on somebody's radar at
          least. Posting them in a public forum and getting people to vote
          or comment on them seems to help too. Submitting a patch, of
          course, gets the most attention but doesn't guarantee resolution
          because the patch might have problems or might not jive with the
          direction they want to take the design.
          We've got a situation where there are only a few hundred
          committers and tens of thousands of bug/enhancement requests so
          anything the community can do to help point out the more
          important ones would be appreciated.

          Could you point out more specifically what one has to do to
          bring up the set imports option (for the long class names)? I
          can't seem to find it (I'm using eclipse 3.1).
          Thanks,

          Sorry about that. The Set Imports is available in the specific
          toolbar for the scrapbook page or via the context menu in the
          editor.
