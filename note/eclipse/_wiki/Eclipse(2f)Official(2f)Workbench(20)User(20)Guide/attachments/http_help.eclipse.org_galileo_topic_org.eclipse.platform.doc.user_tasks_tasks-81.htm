                       Creating a bookmark within a file

   The Workbench allows you to create bookmarks in files that you edit so
   that you can quickly reopen those files from the Bookmarks view (
   [command_link.png] Window > Show View > Other... > General >
   Bookmarks).
    1. With the file open in an editor, right-click in the gray border at
       the left of the editor area, next to the line of code or text that
       you want to bookmark.
    2. Select Add Bookmark from the pop-up menu.
    3. Notice that an icon for the bookmark now appears in the left border
       of the editor area. A line is also added to the Bookmarks view.)

   You can reopen the file for editing at any time by double-clicking the
   bookmark in the Bookmarks view.
