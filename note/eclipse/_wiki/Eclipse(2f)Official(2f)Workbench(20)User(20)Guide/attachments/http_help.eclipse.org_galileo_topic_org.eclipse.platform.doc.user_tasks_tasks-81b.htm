                     Creating a bookmark for an entire file

   You can bookmark individual files in the Workbench, in order to open
   them quickly from the Bookmarks view ( [command_link.png] Window > Show
   View > Other... > General > Bookmarks) later.
    1. In one of the navigation views, select the file that you want to
       add to your list of bookmarks.
    2. From the main Workbench menu select Edit > Add Bookmark.

   At any time, you can open the bookmarked file for editing by
   double-clicking the bookmark in the Bookmarks view.

   You can also create bookmarks for specific lines of text or source code
   or within a file. See the list of related topics below.
