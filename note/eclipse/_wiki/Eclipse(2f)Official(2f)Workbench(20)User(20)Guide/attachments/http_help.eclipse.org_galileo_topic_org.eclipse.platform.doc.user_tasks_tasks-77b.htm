                       Associating a task with a resource

   You can associate tasks with an editable resource, for instance to
   remind yourself to update a line of source code later.
    1. In one of the navigation views, double-click the resource with
       which you wish to associate the new task. The resource opens in the
       editor area.
    2. Right-click in the gray border at the left of the editor area,
       beside the line of text or source code against which you want to
       log the new task.
    3. On the pop-up menu, select Add Task.
    4. When prompted, enter a brief description of the task.

   A new task icon appears in the border of the editor area, to the left
   of the line where you added the task. When you move the mouse pointer
   over the marker, the description of the task is displayed as a tooltip.
   The task is also added to the Tasks view. You can delete a task either
   by right-clicking its icon in the editor area and selecting Remove
   Task, or by pressing the Delete key in the Tasks view.
