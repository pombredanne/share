                         Automatically fixing problems

   Problems displayed in the Problems view may offer a Quick Fix menu
   option in the context menu. Selecting this menu option will present one
   or more possible fixes that can be automatically applied for you.

   Certain Java problems may be resolved using the Quick Fix feature. For
   example, a missing import statement in a Java file will result in a
   Quick Fix suggestion to add the import statement or change the type
   name to a name that is already imported.
    1. In the Problems view, right-click the task you want to Quick Fix.
    2. Select Quick Fix from the pop-up menu.
    3. Choose from one of the suggested fixes.
