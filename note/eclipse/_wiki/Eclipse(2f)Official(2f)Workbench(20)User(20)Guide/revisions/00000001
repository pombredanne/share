== Bookmarks ==
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cbookmrk.htm @2009/12/10

__You can place an "anchor" either on a resource within the Workbench, or at a specific line within a file, by creating a bookmark. (原來書籤也可以加在整支檔案上) Then you can use the Bookmarks view to return to those files quickly.__

The Bookmarks view (Window > Show View > Bookmarks) displays all bookmarks that you have created.

__''Markers'' are objects that may be associated with Workbench resources. There are many uses of markers in the Workbench, including providing support for bookmarking resources or locations within resources, tracking ongoing tasks, or displaying error messages.__ See the related tasks section for more details.

=== Creating a bookmark within a file ===
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-81.htm @2009/12/10

The Workbench allows you to create bookmarks in files that you edit so that you can quickly reopen those files from the Bookmarks view (Window > Show View > Other... > General > Bookmarks).

 1. With the file open in an editor, right-click in the gray border at the left of the editor area, next to the line of code or text that you want to bookmark.

 2. __Select Add Bookmark from the pop-up menu. (開窗輸入這個動作稍嫌麻煩; 雖然 Eclipse 會預設採用該行的內容做為書籤的名稱, 但如果一個快速鍵就可以將某一行標記起來就方便多了...)__

 3. Notice that an icon for the bookmark now appears in the left border of the editor area. A line is also added to the Bookmarks view.)

You can reopen the file for editing at any time by double-clicking the bookmark in the Bookmarks view.

=== Creating a bookmark for an entire file ===
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-81b.htm @2009/12/10

You can bookmark individual files in the Workbench, in order to open them quickly from the Bookmarks view (Window > Show View > Other... > General > Bookmarks) later.

 1. In one of the navigation views, select the file that you want to add to your list of bookmarks.
 2. From the main Workbench menu select Edit > Add Bookmark. (注意不是點右鍵, 而是要用 Eclipse 的主選單)

At any time, you can open the bookmarked file for editing by double-clicking the bookmark in the Bookmarks view.

You can also create bookmarks for specific lines of text or source code or within a file. See the list of related topics below. 

=== Deleting a bookmark ===
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-82.htm @2009/12/10

To delete any bookmark:

 1. Open the Bookmarks view (Window > Show View > Other... > General > Bookmarks).
 2. Right-click the bookmark that you want to delete and select Delete from the pop-up menu.

If you have added bookmarks for specific lines within a source file, you can also delete them while editing the file by right-clicking the bookmark icon in the editor area.
 
=== Adding line items in the Tasks view ===
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-77.htm @2009/12/10

The Tasks view contains line items for ''system-generated'' problems, warnings, and errors. __You can add your own entries to the table to build a list of to-do items, or tasks.__

 1. On the toolbar in the Tasks view, click the New Task button New Task button. The New Task dialog will open.

 2. Type a brief description for the task in the Description field. The new task is assigned default priority and completed values. These values may also be modified within the New Task dialog.

 3. Press OK.

=== Associating a task with a resource ===
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-77b.htm @2009/12/10

__You can associate tasks with an ''editable'' resource, for instance to remind yourself to update a line of source code later. (跟 Bookmarks 的定位不太一樣, 它有 "標示為已完成" 的概念)__

 1. In one of the navigation views, double-click the resource with which you wish to associate the new task. The resource opens in the editor area.

 2. Right-click in the gray border at the left of the editor area, beside the line of text or source code against which you want to log the new task.

 3. On the pop-up menu, select Add Task.

 4. When prompted, enter a brief description of the task.

A new task icon appears in the border of the editor area, to the left of the line where you added the task. When you move the mouse pointer over the marker, the description of the task is displayed as a tooltip. The task is also added to the Tasks view. You can delete a task either by right-clicking its icon in the editor area and selecting Remove Task, or by pressing the Delete key in the Tasks view.

=== Deleting tasks ===
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-78.htm @2009/12/10

You can delete ''associated'' tasks from the gray border at the left of the editor area.

 1. In the ''marker bar'' in the editor area, locate the task marker that you want to delete.
 2. From the marker's pop-up menu, select Remove Task.
 3. The task marker disappears and the task is removed from the Tasks view.

You can also delete one or more line items from the Tasks view by pressing the Delete key or by clicking the Delete button on the Tasks view toolbar, or from the pop-up menu.

__Tip: To delete all completed tasks, right-click in the Tasks view and select Delete Completed Tasks from the pop-up menu.__

=== Filtering the Tasks and Problems views ===
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-79.htm @2009/12/10

You can filter the tasks or problems that are displayed in the Tasks or Problems views. For example, you might wish to see only problems that have been logged by the Workbench, or tasks that you have logged as reminders to yourself. You can filter items according to which resource or group of resources they are associated with, by text string within the Description field, by problem severity, by task priority, or by task status.

 1. On the toolbar of the Tasks or Problems view, click Filter.
 2. Select the radio buttons and checkboxes that correspond to your filtering objectives.
 3. Click OK.

=== Automatically fixing problems ===
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tquickfix.htm @2009/12/10

Problems displayed in the Problems view may offer a Quick Fix menu option in the context menu. Selecting this menu option will present one or more possible fixes that can be automatically applied for you.

Certain Java problems may be resolved using the Quick Fix feature. For example, a missing import statement in a Java file will result in a Quick Fix suggestion to add the import statement or change the type name to a name that is already imported.

 1. In the Problems view, right-click the task you want to Quick Fix.
 2. Select Quick Fix from the pop-up menu.
 3. Choose from one of the suggested fixes.
