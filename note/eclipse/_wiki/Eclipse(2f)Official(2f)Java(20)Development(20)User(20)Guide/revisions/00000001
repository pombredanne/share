=== Using the Scrapbook ===
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/concepts/cscrapbook.htm @2009/11/30

__The Java development toolkit (JDT) contributes a scrapbook facility that can be used to experiment and evaluate Java code snippets before building a complete Java program.__ Snippets are edited and evaluated in the Scrapbook page editor, with resultant problems reported in the editor.

From a Java scrapbook editor, you can select a code snippet, evaluate it, and display the result as a string. You can also show the object that results from evaluating a code snippet in the debuggers' Expressions View.

==== Creating a Java Scrapbook Page ====
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-create_scrapbook_page.htm @2009/11/30

__The scrapbook allows Java expressions, to be run, inspected, and displayed ''under the control of the debugger''.[?] Breakpoints and exceptions behave as they do in a regular debug session.__

__Code is edited on a scrapbook page.  '''A VM is launched for each scrapbook page in which expressions are being evaluated. The first time an expression is evaluated in a scrapbook page after it is opened, a VM is launched. The VM for a page will remain active until the page is closed, terminated explicitly (in the debugger or via the Stop the Evaluation button in the editor toolbar), or when a `System.exit()` is evaluated.'''__

There are several ways to open the Opens the New Java Scrapbook wizard New Java Scrapbook Page wizard.

 * Create a file with a `.jpage` extension
 * From the menu bar, select File > New > Other.... Then select Java > Java Run/Debug > Scrapbook Page. Then click Next.

Once you've opened the New Java Scrapbook Page wizard:.

 1. In the Enter or select the folder field, type or click Browse to select the container for the new page.

 2. In the File name field, type a name for the new page. The `.jpage` extension will be added automatically if you do not type it yourself.

 3. Click Finish when you are done. The new scrapbook page opens in an editor.

==== Inspecting the result of evaluating an expression ====
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-inspect_evaluation_result.htm @2009/11/30

Inspecting shows the result of evaluating an expression in the ''Expressions view''.

 1. In the scrapbook page, either type an expression or highlight an existing expression to be inspected. For example: `System.getProperties();`

 2. Click the Inspect button in the toolbar (or select Inspect from the selection's pop-up menu).

 3. __The result of the inspection appears in a pop-up. (按 Shift + Ctrl + I 就可以嵌進 Expressions View)__

 4. The result can be inspected like a variable in the debugger (for example, children of the result can be expanded).

==== Displaying the result of evaluating an expression ====
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-display_evaluation_result.htm @2009/11/30

Displaying shows the result of evaluating an expression in the scrapbook editor.

 1. In the scrapbook page, either type an expression or highlight an existing expression to be displayed. For example: `System.getProperties();`

 2. Click the Display button in the toolbar (or select Display from the selection's pop-up menu.)

 3. The result of the evaluation appears highlighted in the scrapbook editor. The result displayed is either

    * the value obtained by sending `toString()` to the result of the evaluation, or

    * when evaluating a primitive data type (e.g., an `int`), the result is the simple value of the result.

For example:

 * Type and highlight new `java.util.Date()` in the editor, and click Display. A result such as `(java.util.Date) Tue Jun 12 14:03:17 CDT 2001` appears in the editor.

 * As another example, type and highlight `3 + 4` in the editor, and press Display. The result `(int) 7` is displayed in the editor.

==== Running an expression ====
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-executing_an_expression.htm @2009/11/30

__Executing an expression evaluates an expression ''but does not display a result''.__

If you select the expression to execute and click the Execute button in the toolbar, no result is displayed, but the code is executed.

For example, if you type and highlight `System.out.println("Hello World")`, and click the Execute button, `Hello World` appears in the Console view, but no result is displayed in the scrapbook editor or the Expressions view.

==== Using code assist ====
http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-scrapbook_content_assist.htm @2009/11/30

The scrapbook editor supports code assist similarly to the regular Java editor.

For example, type `TestCase` in the scrapbook editor and press Ctrl+Space. Code assist prompts you with possible completions.
