                         Creating a Java Scrapbook Page

   The scrapbook allows Java expressions, to be run, inspected, and
   displayed under the control of the debugger. Breakpoints and exceptions
   behave as they do in a regular debug session.

   Code is edited on a scrapbook page.  A VM is launched for each
   scrapbook page in which expressions are being evaluated. The first time
   an expression is evaluated in a scrapbook page after it is opened, a VM
   is launched. The VM for a page will remain active until the page is
   closed, terminated explicitly (in the debugger or via the Stop the
   Evaluation button in the editor toolbar), or when a System.exit() is
   evaluated.

   There are several ways to open the Opens the New Java Scrapbook wizard
   New Java Scrapbook Page wizard.
     * Create a file with a .jpage extension
     * From the menu bar, select File > New > Other.... Then select Java >
       Java Run/Debug > Scrapbook Page. Then click Next.

   Once you've opened the New Java Scrapbook Page wizard:.
    1. In the Enter or select the folder field, type or click Browse to
       select the container for the new page.
    2. In the File name field, type a name for the new page. The .jpage
       extension will be added automatically if you do not type it
       yourself.
    3. Click Finish when you are done. The new scrapbook page opens in an
       editor.
