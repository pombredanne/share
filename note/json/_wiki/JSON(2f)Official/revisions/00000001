__JSON (!JavaScript Object Notation) is a ''lightweight data-interchange format''. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the !JavaScript Programming Language, http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ecma-st/ECMA-262.pdf[Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999]. JSON is a text format that is completely ''language independent'' but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, !JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal ''data-interchange language''.__

JSON is built on two structures:

 * __A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array[associative array].__

 * __An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.__

__These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. '''It makes sense that a data format that is interchangable with programming languages also be based on these structures.'''__

In JSON, they take on these forms:

__An ''object'' is an unordered set of name/value pairs.__ An object begins with `{` (left brace) and ends with `}` (right brace). Each name is followed by `:` (colon) and the name/value pairs are separated by `,` (comma).

__An ''array'' is an ordered collection of values.__ An array begins with `[` (left bracket) and ends with `]` (right bracket). Values are separated by `,` (comma).

__A ''value'' can be a string in double quotes, or a number, or `true` or `false` or `null`, or an object or an array. '''These structures can be nested.'''__

__A ''string'' is a collection of zero or more Unicode characters, wrapped in double quotes, using backslash escapes. A character is represented as a single character string.__ A string is very much like a C or Java string.

__A ''number'' is very much like a C or Java number, except that the octal and hexadecimal formats are not used.__

__Whitespace can be inserted between any pair of tokens.__ Excepting a few encoding details, that completely describes the language.

 * 無法決定程式要直接輸出 XML 或 JSON 嗎? 只要固定輸出 XML 即可, 因為 JSON 可以透過 XSLT (可以用 Servlet Filter 來實作) 從 XML 直接轉換出來. @2009/01/14
