leJOS 是從早期用在 RCX 上的 http://tinyvm.sourceforge.net/[TinyVM] 分支出來的 JVM，2006 年被移植（port）到 Lego NXT 上。

== 雜記 ==

 * v0.85 Netbeans plugin
 * v0.7 Eclipse Plugin
   ** http://lejos.sourceforge.net/tools/eclipse/plugin/nxj/
 * 2011-05-16 釋出 leJOS NXJ 0.9，加入 preliminary Android OS support，接下來就是 v1.0 了。
   ** 從 http://sourceforge.net/projects/lejos/files/lejos-NXJ/ 這裡看來，1.0 就要出 beta 了
 * v0.85 才支持 instanceof，還有哪些限制呢？
   ** Most of the java.lang, java.util and java.io classes
   ** support generics, nanosecond, new sensors
   ** limited java.awt and java.awt.geom classes
   ** Preemptive threads (tasks)
   ** It support the latest Java 1.6 language features.
 * icon-based menu system
 * reworking the navigation API to accomodate different robot types, object detection, and path finding.
 * platform independent lejos.robotics packages，為什麼會有 platform 的問題？
 * new concepts of pose controllers and path finders
 * javax.microedition.location for Bluetooth GPS
 * mobile phone remote control
 * It supports Bluetooth keyboards that use the Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP).
 * iCommand is dead! Long live iCommand. PC control is now included in pccomm.jar and the lejos.nxt.remote package (see pcsamples).
 * Mindsensors NXTCam, HiTechnic Gyro sensor
 * I2C support?
 * # It supports localization including Monte Carlo Localization (MCL).
 * A PC API for writing PC programs that communicate with leJOS NXJ programs using Java streams over Bluetooth or USB, or using the LEGO Communications Protocol (LCP).
   ** It supports remote execution of a large subset of the API from the PC.
 * It has full support for Bluetooth, USB, I2C and RS485 protocols.
   ** It supports NXT to NXT Bluetooth and RS485 communications.
 * It provides Behavior classes that support the subsumption architecture for ease of programming of complex robot behaviors.
 * It supports remote logging to the PC over Bluetooth or USB, optionally by redirecting System.out and System.err.
 * It supports remote monitoring and tracing of your leJOS NXJ program from the PC.
 * It supports listeners and events.
 * It has a flash file system accessed by the standard java.io classes.
 * It has telerobotics support via standard TCP/IP sockets?? 用 Andriod 搖控？
 * It supports Bluetooth communication with other devices, such as GPS receivers.
 * It provides compatibility with Lego Communications Protocol (LCP), so that many tools that work with the standard LEGO firmware, also work with leJOS.
 * It has support for simple computer "vision" applications??
 * Another option you can use to compile and run your leJOS NXJ programs is to use ant build scripts. Netbeans does all compiling and building of programs using ant, and it is an option in Eclipse.
