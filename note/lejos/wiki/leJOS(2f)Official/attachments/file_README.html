                               What is leJOS NXJ?

   leJOS (sometimes pronounced like the Spanish word "lejos" for "far") is
   a tiny Java-based operating system that has been ported to the
   following platforms:
     * LEGO Mindstorms NXT
     * LEGO Mindstorms RCX
     * Unix (for emulation of leJOS programs only)

   leJOS was originally forked out of the
   [14]TinyVM project. It contains a VM for Java bytecodes and additional
   software to load and run Java programs. These are some of the features
   offered:
     * Object oriented language (Java)
     * Preemptive threads (tasks)
     * Arrays, including multi-dimensional ones
     * Recursion
     * Synchronization
     * Exceptions
     * Java types including float, double, long and String
     * Math class
     * Well-documented Robotics API

   leJOS NXJ is the version of leJOS for the LEGO Mindstorms NXT. It uses
   the same Java VM as the RCX version, but has new drivers for the NXT
   hardware.

   leJOS NXJ adds lots of new capability to leJOS including a file system,
   a menu system, and support for I2C sensors, including those from third
   parties. The built-in tachometers in the NXT motors have enabled much
   improved control over speed, steering and navigation.

   Bluetooth and USB communications are a great improvement over the
   infra-red link used by the RCX.

                                 Preliminaries

     * You need a Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.5 or later.
     * Your PATH must contain the JDK's bin directory.
     * Make sure you have set JAVA_HOME properly to the root directory of
       the JDK (necessary if you use ant).
     * On systems other than Microsoft Windows, you will need to build the
       distribution, so your PATH must contain the ant binary (ant 1.7 or
       above).
     * On Microsoft Windows and MAC OS X you will need the LEGO Mindstorms
       NXT software installed, as its USB drivers are used.
     * On MAC OS X systems, you will need the OS X developer tools
       installed.

   libusb must be installed on Linux and can be obtained from
   [15]http://libusb.sourceforge.net.
   On Linux systems, if you are running leJOS NXJ from a non-root user,
   you will need to ensure that you have read and write access the NXT USB
   device in /dev/bus/usb. If you can identify the device in /dev/bus/usb,
   you can do this by:
   sudo chmod a+w /dev/bus/usb/xxx/yyy
   However, the yyy number will count up each time the NXT is disconnected
   and reconnected.
   A better solution is to use udev rules or pamcomsole. How to do this
   varies with different Linux systems. A pamconsole solution that works
   on Fedora systems, is to create a file
   /etc/security/console.perms.d/60-libusb.perms with the two lines:
   <usbdevices>=/dev/bus/usb/*/*
   <console> 0600 <usbdevices> 0644 root
   To use udev rules, set up a file such as
   /etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules and populate it with the following
   lines:
   # Lego NXT
   BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="03eb", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"
   BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0694", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"
   This relies on the username you are using being in the lego group. You
   can modify the file to your requirements. The two vendors are LEGO and
   Atmel (for the samba driver used in firmware update mode). You may need
   to restart udev.

                            Installation and Set Up

    1. Extract the files from the distribution. A lejos_nxj subdirectory
       will be created.
    2. Set the environment variable NXJ_HOME to the full path of the
       lejos_nxj directory.
    3. Add the lejos_nxj/bin directory to your PATH.
    4. On Linux and Unix Systems, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to your
       lejos_nxj/bin directory. On some systems this is best set in
       /etc/profile. On MAC OSX systems, you should set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
       instead.
    5. On Linux and Unix systems, depending on your privilege settings you
       might need to adjust the execution permissions in the bin
       directory.

   On Linux and Unix systems, you will have to build the distribution
   first. To do so, switch to the build folder and run ant. You will need
   to ensure that the packages that leJOS NXJ is dependent on are on your
   system. These include libusb-dev, gcj and libbluetooth-dev.

                                Using leJOS NXJ

     * Flash the leJOS NXJ firmware using nxjflash.
     * Compile using nxjc instead of javac.
     * Link, upload and run programs using nxj.
     * Exceptions: Use nxj --verbose to get information on methods and
       special classes used by your program. Exceptions are shown on the
       NXT as Method:XXXX, CLASS:YY, where XXXX = method_signature and YY
       = exception_class_index

   Your NXT must be plugged into the USB, switched on to run nxjflash.
   Note that the standard LEGO firmware will be overwritten and all
   existing data lost. You can reinstall the LEGO firmware using the LEGO
   Mindstorms software.

   If you have an old version of leJOS on your NXT, or another third-party
   operating system, you may need to be in firmware update mode. To put
   the next in firmware upload, press the reset button with a paper clip
   for 4 seconds or more. The NXT brick will start to tick.

   To run nxjflash, open a command window, and type nxjflash

   nxjflash will write the Java VM and the leJOS NXJ start-up menu to the
   flash memory of your NXT. It will create an empty user flash area. When
   the flash procedure has finished, leJOS NXJ will start up and an empty
   menu will be displayed.

   You can switch the NXT off at any time, including when a program is
   running, by pressing the orange and dark gray buttons (ENTER + ESCAPE)
   together. To switch it back on just press the orange button. The leJOS
   NXJ start-up menu will be displayed.
   If your NXT freezes at any time, remove and re-insert a battery.

                     Compiling and running your first code

   To compile, link and download the Tune sample:
     * Open a command window
     * Check that java and lejos_nxj are on your PATH
     * Check that the NXJ_HOME environment variable is defined
     * Change to the projects\samples\Tune directory
     * Type nxjc Tune.java
     * Check that your USB cable is connected
     * Check that the NXT is turned on
     * Type nxj -r Tune

   After a few seconds, you should hear an ascending tone sequence
   indicating that the program uploaded OK. You will then hear a tune
   play. When it has finished the leJOS NXJ menu will be displayed.

   When you switch your NXT back on, select "Files" and press ENTER and
   you will see "Tune.nxj" in the files menu

   You can navigate through the leJOS NXJ menus using the left and right
   buttons. You select a menu item by pressing ENTER, and exit from a menu
   by pressing ESCAPE. There are 3 menus: Files, Bluetooth ands System. To
   select a program, go to the Files menu, scroll down to your program and
   press the ENTER button. You will then see a sub-menu that lets you
   execute or delete the program.

                                leJOS NXJ Tools

   The following tools are available with leJOS NXJ:
     * nxjflash - flashes the firmware and leJOS menu
     * nxjc - compiles a Java program for leJOS NXJ
     * nxj - links, uploads and optionally runs a leJOS NXJ program
     * nxjlink - links a program
     * nxjupload - uploads and optionally runs a program
     * nxjbrowse - explorer for NXJ files
     * nxjflashg - GUI version of nxjflash
     * nxjmonitor - remote monitoring and tracing over Bluetooth
     * nxjconsole - remote debugging over USB or Bluetooth
     * nxjconsoleviewer - GUI version of nxjconsole
     * nxjdataviewer - remote viewer for Datalogger files
     * nxjproxyserver - proxy server for Socket and SocketServer
       connections
     * nxjcontrol - a GUI tool that combines the functions of nxjbrowse,
       nxjconsoleviewer, nxjdataviewer and nxjmonitor.

   nxj, nxjupload and nxjbrowse can be used over Bluetooth or USB. By
   default they try to use USB first, and if this fails, they try
   Bluetooth

   Use the --usb flag to select usb only, or --bluetooth for Bluetooth
   only.

   nxjbrowse displays a list of all the NXTs that it finds, and allows you
   to select one to connect to. nxj and nxjupload, try each NXT they find
   in turn until they successfully connect to one. To pick a specific NXT
   to connect to by name, use the --name flag. In this release, --name
   works for both Bluetooth and USB.

   You can connect to a specific NXT by address, using the --address flag.
   If you specify the address, a Bluetooth inquiry will not be done, and
   the connection will be much faster. Use nxjbrowse to list the addresses
   of your NXT devices. An address is 12 hex digits with optional colons
   between the hex pairs.

   The leJOS NXJ tools can use different comms driver to connect to the
   NXT. The default driver for USB on Windows is NXTCommFantom which uses
   the LEGO fantom API and on other systems is NXTCommLibnxt, which uses
   David Anderson's libnxt library and the libusb open source library. At
   this release, all systems use NXTCommBluecove as the Bluetooth comms
   driver. This uses libraries from the Bluecove open source project.

   The properties file, lejos_nxt/bin/nxj.properties, can be modified to
   select different comms drivers.

   nxjbrowse lists the files on the NXT and includes their size, and start
   and end pages. It can be used to delete, upload and download programs
   and other files. It can also run programs, change the name of the NXT
   and defrag the files, moving them all to the start of user flash
   memory.

   nxjmonitor can be used to monitor a running program on the NXT. The
   program being monitored should run the LCPBTResponder thread and can
   output trace messages using LCP.messageWrite on message box 0 - see the
   MonitorTest sample. nxjmonitor produces a graphical display of the
   current values of sensors, the battery and motor tachometers as the
   program runs, as well as displaying the trace messages.

   nxjconsole displays messages output by the RConsole class on the NXT.
   One way to use RConsole is to include a call to RConsole.openUSB(0) at
   the start of your leJOS program, and RConsole.close() at the end. A
   stream such as stderr can then be redirected to the remote console by
   System.setErr(new PrintStream(RConsole.openOutputStream()));.
   openBluetooth(0) can be used instead of openUSB(0).

   nxjconsoleviewer is a GUI version of nxjconsole

   nxjdataviewer views data log file produced by the Datalogger class -
   see the DLTest sample.

   nxjproxyserver runs a proxy server that can be used to support Socket
   and SocketServer connections between programs running on the NXT and
   Java programs on a PC or across the Internet - see the SocketTest,
   SocketServer and TimeTest samples.

   nxjcontrol is a GUI tool that allows you to control multiple NXTs. It
   has all the functions of nxjbrowse, but also allow you to control and
   monitor your NXT. It includes the function of nxjconsoleviewer and
   nxjdataviewer.

                            Using the debug monitor

   At this release it is possible to include a debug monitor thread as
   part of the uploaded binary by specifying the --debug option on nxj or
   nxjlink.

   The debug monitor is the start of a more fully featured remote
   debugging capability that will be added in a future release. The debug
   monitor gives a more details when an untrapped exception occurs
   including simple stack trace that shows methods called by method
   number, and allows you to interrupt a running program by pressing
   ENTER+ESCAPE.

   When an interrupt occurs a thread dump is displayed. It lists the
   threads in you program in reverse order of priority. The thread number,
   state and the numbers of the last 3 executed methods is displayed for
   each thread. The thread states are:-
   R - the thread is runnable
   S - the thread is sleeping
   D - the thread is dead
   N - the thread is new (not yet started)
   I - the thread has been started but not yet run
   E - the thread is waiting for a synchronized section
   W - the thread is waiiting on a monitor object
   * this is the running thread (not the debug thread)

   After a user interrupt or exception, ENTER+ESCAPE shuts down the brick,
   ESCAPE terminates the user program and restarts the menu. Any other key
   continues the user program.

                               Known limitations

   Due to size constraints, some Java language features have been omitted.
   Others just haven't been implemented yet. Known limitations with all
   versions of leJOS are:
     * The instanceof operation will always be true for interfaces. In
       bytecode, CHECKCAST succeeds on all interface classes (which is a
       bit unsafe)
     * There are no objects of type java.lang.Class, which means that the
       ".class" construct won't work. Class.forName() throws
       ClassNotFoundException at all times. As a consequence, reflection
       is not supported by leJOS
     * Most JDK APIs are unavailable

                                   Known Bugs

   The following bugs apply to all versions of leJOS:
     * MONITOREXIT ignores null objects (it assumes MONITORENTER has
       handled them). Furthermore, it doesn't check monitor validity.
       Until this bug is fixed (actually, at all times) all monitors
       should be constants
     * Initializers (static or otherwise) are not implicitly synchronized.
       This could lead to access of statics before they are initialized,
       when multiple threads use a class

                    Known Bugs and Limitations in leJOS NXJ

   The following bugs and limitations apply to the current version of
   leJOS NXJ:
     * It is a good idea to restart the brick after flashing leJOS. If not
       problems with motors can occur.
     * Only one file can be open at a time.
     * leJOS NXJ only supports program upload and download, tools such as
       nxjbrowse, and LEGO communications Protocol commands when the
       start-up menu is running, not when a user program is running,
       unless a user program explicitly starts the LCPResponder thread.
     * The number of files that can be uploaded to lejos NXJ is limited by
       the fact that the whole file table must fit into two 256-byte
       pages. If the average filename length is 15 characters,
       approximately 20 files are supported.
     * The maximum filename length is 20 characters.
     * Not all LEGO Communications Protocol command are supported, and the
       semantics of some of them are different from that of the standard
       LEGO firmware. In particular only one file can be open at a time
       and the file handle is always 0.
     * Support for sound sample files is limited to 8-bit WAV files.
     * Data aborts occur if there is a failure in the NXJ VM. If a data
       abort occurs, it is necessary to remove and re-insert a battery.
     * It is sometimes necessary to pair your NXT using the Operating
       System before it can be connected to by the leJOS NXJ PC tools and
       libraries. This depends on what Bluetooth stack you are using.
     * Discovery of Bluetooth devices is slow, taking at least 10 seconds.
       It is slower still with Bluez on Linux. However, a cache of NXT
       names and addresses is now held in the file nxj.cache in the user's
       home directory, so an inquiry is usually omly necessary one. You
       can force an inquiry by deleting the file, specifying "*" as the
       name or using a name that has not been used before.

                                 Documentation

   The API docs for leJOS NXJ is included in the download. You can also
   access them on the leJOS web site.
