   Just in time for the new semester we have leJOS NXJ 0.85 ready for
   download. This is an intermediary release (as indicated by the .05)
   that previews some upcoming technology, however 0.9 will represent the
   final push for major changes before we settle down to a stable 1.0
   release. Major bug fixes and improvements include:
     * better support and documentation for MAC OS X, including the Fantom
       USB driver
     * a Netbeans plugin
     * improved JVM speed and many more amazing improvements by Andy
     * support for the new LEGO color sensor in the NXT 2.0 set
     * now supports the instanceof keyword
     * detection of rechargeable batteries and improved battery indicator
     * nanosecond timers and improved timer support with the Delay class.
     * % operation on floats and doubles
     * Class, including the isAssignableFrom(Class cls) method
     * display of LCD screen in ConsoleViewer
     * major speed and accuracy improvements to the Math class from Sven
     * platform independent lejos.robotics packages
     * new navigation proposal (work in progress) that is platform
       independent, supports more vehicles, has better localization
       support, and new concepts of pose controllers and path finders
     * preliminary support for probabilistic robotics, including general
       purpose KalmanFilter class using matrix algebra
     * reworking of the Monte Carlo Localization classes
     * limited java.awt and java.awt.geom classes

   See the release notes for a full list of changes. As usual, feel free
   to visit our forums and discuss anything and everything.

   leJOS NXJ 0.3 is out! After a long and painful delay (especially for
   the developers) the new and improved version of leJOS NXJ is finally
   available in the downloads. This new version has many new features
   including storing programs and data to flash memory, a menu system, a
   file system, and an explorer that runs on your computer. Let us know
   what you think in the forums!

   There's been a holdup! For those who have been waiting for the next
   release of leJOS NXJ, we'd like to apologize for the unexpected delay.
   Owners of Maximum LEGO NXT: Building Robots with Java Brains should
   ignore the install instructions in the book until the next version is
   released (for now you can use the slightly more primitive leJOS NXJ
   0.2.0). More information on this delay can be found in the forums here
   and here. Thanks for your patience.
   [maximum_nxt_thumb.jpg] April 18, 2007 6:10 PM
   Announcing Maximum LEGO NXT: Building Robots with Java Brains, a new
   book for LEGO NXT programmers. This is a follow-up to Core LEGO
   MINDSTORMS Programming. The book includes 14 complete robot plans and
   over two dozen projects, with a foreword by the Director of LEGO
   MINDSTORMS, Søren Lund. Maximum LEGO NXT will be available from the
   publisher April 25, 2007 or from book stores and online retailers about
   a week later. For more information visit the website.

   leJOS NXJ Alpha 0.2 is now available. This release contains preliminary
   Bluetooth support, I2C support (Ultrasonic sensor), and sound support.

   Download Now.
   [nxj.jpg] January 10, 2007 12:08 PM
   leJOS NXJ is ready for download. leJOS NXJ is a full firmware
   replacement and works for Windows and Linux. This is a technology
   preview of things to come. At the moment there is no Bluetooth, I2C
   (Ultrasonic sensor), or sound support and we do not have a basic menu
   system. You can write Java programs and upload them to the NXT brick
   via USB. (see readme for more information) Download Now.

   commands more precisely (as seen in the iCommand API) and adds
   functions for the Ultrasonic sensor. It's still not perfect but it is
   starting to show some potential. Download Now.
   [nxj.jpg] August 28, 2006 11:13 PM
   Introducing iCommand 0.3, a Java API for controlling the Lego NXT
   brick. iCommand allows you to program your robot and control it using
   your Bluetooth connection. The iCommand API is modelled on the leJOS
   API with some differences. Note: This is not a firmware replacement.
   Download now.
   [rcxjava.jpg] August 20, 2006 8:50 AM
   All's well that ends well: the first release candidate for leJOS 3.0 is
   out now! leJOS 3.0 is meant to be the final release for the RCX,
   incorporating all the enhancements made to leJOS since the last
   official release (2.1.0) in 2003 (before we hit the road for Java
   support for the RCX's successor, the NXT). Be sure to check it out in
   the downloads section and provide feedback to the authors.
   [nxt_robot.jpg] January 5, 2006 9:53 AM
   At the January CES, Lego announced the next generation of Lego
   Mindstorms, called Lego NXT. The kit is scheduled for launch in
   September 2006 but they will be releasing 100 developer kits in
   February. We hope members of the leJOS team will receive these kits,
   and if we do we will be porting leJOS for the NXT so people can
   continue to develop their next generation robots in Java!

                                                                       Top

   Disclaimer: Java is a trademark of Sun Microsystems. Lego Mindstorms is
   a trademark of the LEGO Group. There is no association between Lego and
   leJOS or Sun and leJOS, or even between Lego and Sun as far as we know.
