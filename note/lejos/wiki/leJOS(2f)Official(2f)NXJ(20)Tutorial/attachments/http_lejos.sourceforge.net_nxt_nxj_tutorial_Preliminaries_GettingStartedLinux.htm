   Getting Started on Linux

   This version of the tutorial is for the 0.85 release of leJOS NXJ.

Prerequisites

Java Development Kit

   You will also need a Java Development Kit (JDK) on your PC. Note that a
   Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is not sufficient as it does not allow
   you to compile Java programs. You can download the latest JDK from
   http://java.sun.com/. Follow the instructions for installing it. leJOS
   NXJ works has been tested with JDK versions 1.5 and 1.6, but will not
   work with earlier versions. JDK 1.6 is recommended as some PC samples
   do not work with JDK 1.5. Note that leJOS has only been tested with the
   official Sun JDK.

   You will need to add the JDK bin directory to your system or user PATH,
   so that commands such as javac and java can be called from a command
   prompt. If you do not know how to do this, see Setting up environment
   variables below.

   It is also a good idea to set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the
   folder where you installed the JDK, as it is necessary if you use the
   ant build system.

libusb

   In order to use a USB connection to your NXT brick on Linux, you will
   need libusb installed on your sysyem. leJOS requires the legacy 0.1.12
   release. On most Linux distributions the 0.1.12 version of the libusb
   package will normally be installed, but the libusb development package
   may not be.. You can get more information from
   http://libusb.sourceforge.net

Package Dependencies

   You will need to ensure that the packages that leJOS NXJ is dependent
   on are on your system. To build the jlibnxt JNI library, which is used
   for USB access, you need the Development files for libusb
   (libusb-devel). Note that leJOS NXJ uses libusb (legacy release
   0.1.12), not libusb1. To build the jbluez library, you need the
   Development Libraries for Bluetooth applications (bluez-libs-devel).
   jbluez is only needed if you use the NXTCommBluez comms driver instead
   of the default NXTCommBluecove. If you do not need jbluez, you can
   remove the build of it from the build/build.xml file. Note that package
   names and descriptions may differ with different Linux distributions.

Accessing USB devices

   If you are running leJOS NXJ from a non-root user, you will need to
   ensure that you have read and write access the NXT USB device in
   /dev/bus/usb. If you can identify the device in /dev/bus/usb, you can
   do this by:

   sudo chmod a+w /dev/bus/usb/xxx/yyy

   However, the yyy number will count up each time the NXT is disconnected
   and reconnected.

   A better solution is to use udev rules. How to do this may vary with
   different Linux systems.

   To use udev rules, set up a file such as
   /etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules and populate it with the following
   lines:
   # Lego NXT
   BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="03eb", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"
   BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0694", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"

   This relies on the username you are using being in the lego group. You
   can modify the file to your requirements. The two vendors are LEGO and
   Atmel (for the samba driver used in firmware update mode). You may need
   to reload the rules or restart udev. On some Linux systems, the command
   to reload the rules is udevadm control --reload-rules.

Bluetooth

   If you want to communicate with the NXT over Bluetooth, you will need a
   Linux supported Bluetooth dongle or built-in support on your PC. By
   default leJOS uses Bluecove with is included in the distribution, but
   there is an option to use the Linux BlueZ API directly.

   You can use leJOS NXJ without Bluetooth.

Downloading the software

   You can download the leJOS NXJ software from The leJOS NXJ download
   page.

   On Linux, leJOS is distributed as a .tar.gz file.

Installing leJOS

Unpacking the release

   Unpack the release a directory of your choice, e.g. /opt/lejos/

Setting up environment variables

   You need to set:

   Variable Value Example
   NXJ_HOME The folder you installed leJOS NXJ into /opt/lejos
   JAVA_HOME The folder where you installed the JDK /usr/java/
   PATH Add the bin folders for the JDK and leJOS
   $PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$NXJ_HOME/bin

   Setting JAVA_HOME is not always necessary, but is good practice. The
   bin directory for the JDK may already be on your PATH.

   With most Linux distributions, you can set these environment variables
   for the current user in .bash_profile or for all users in /etc/profile.
   If you use Eclipse and the Eclipse plugin, you will also need to add
   $NXJ_HOME/bin to LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the Eclipse plugin can access
   the leJOS NXJ JNI libraries. This should normally be done in
   /etc/profile, but this may differ for different Linux distributions.

Building the release

   To build the release, change directory to lejos_nxj/build and type ant.
   If you have all the dependent packages installed the release should
   build without errors.

   If you do not need jbluez, and you do not have the package dependices
   for it, you can remove it from the build.xml file.

Flashing the Firmware

   As leJOS NXJ is a firmware replacement, you will need to flash the
   firmware to your NXT. Note that this will overwrite any existing
   firmware. If you have the standard LEGO firmware or other third-party
   firmware on your NXT, existing files will be lost.

   Note that the 0.85 release changes the amount of flash memory reserved
   for the firmware and the startup menu, so when you first flash the 0.85
   firmware any existing files will be lost

   Make sure your NXT is attached to the PC by its USB cable, and switch
   it on by pressing the orange button.

   You can either use the command line nxjflash command or the nxjflashg
   GUI program.

   Using the command line:

   Type nxjflash to flash the leJOS NXJ firmware. If your NXT is in
   firmware update mode, the firmware will be updated. You will see some
   messages on your command window, and the NXT should show the leJOS
   splash screen and then the leJOS NXJ menu. If your NXT has a previous
   version of the leJOS or LEGO firmware on it, a list of the NXTs
   connected to the USB will be shown, and you will be asked to input the
   number in the list of the NXT you want updated - this will be 1 if a
   single NXT is connected to your PC. If your NXT has other firmware on
   it, or if nxjflash fails, you must put your NXT into firmware update
   mode. Press the reset button (at the back of the NXT , upper left
   corner) for more than 4 seconds. A straightened paper clip could be
   useful for this. Your NXT will audibly tick when it is firmware update
   mode. Then try nxjflash again.

   Using the GUI version:

   To run the GUI version type nxjflashg. When the program window opens,
   click on Start Program and follow the instructions. A more complete
   explanation is in the PC GUI Tools tutorial page.

Testing your Installation

   You can check that you have successfully installed leJOS NXJ on your PC
   and your NXT by compiling and running your first program.

Compiling and running your first program

   Java programs need to be compiled to class files before they can be
   run. For leJOS NXJ, all the class files that are to be run on the NXT
   needed to be linked to produce a binary file (with the extension .nxj)
   and this must then be uploaded to the NXT.

   To run a sample program, such as the View.java sample, follow these
   steps:
   Start a shell session, and change directory to the
   lejos_nxj/projects/samples/View folder:

   Compile the program with the nxjc command:
 nxjc View.java

   Then link, upload and run it with the nxj command:
 nxj -r View

   You should see the menu of the View sample on your NXT.
