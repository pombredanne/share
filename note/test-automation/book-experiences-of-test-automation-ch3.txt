== SUT ==

 * Exchange Server 2010—business-class email server
 * Number of testers: >150
 : Number of automators: >150 (diff between testers and automators?)
 * Tools: Microsoft Visual Studio Team System; rest of tools were inhouse developed.
 * ROI measured: No; product strategy change forced us to adapt, so *ROI was never done*.
 * 5000 machines in test labs 70,000 automated test cases run multiple times a day on these machines.
 * We needed to architect for multitenancy so that a single instance of the service could serve multiple client organizations (tenants).
 * We needed to scale units (sometimes called pods) as logically grouped subsets of machines fulfilling a function and being useful when planning procurement units.
 * Our service must be geodistributed to support business continuance planning (BCP) and to reduce latency by geographic markets.

== Testing in Production (TiP) ==

 * moved from product-based to service-based automated testing by implementing the automation in the cloud.
 * Testing in production seems a foreign concept to most testers, but this chapter explains why it was necessary and beneficial to move to continuous monitoring.

== Dogfooding ==

________________________________________________________________________________
Eating your own dog food, also called dogfooding, is a slang term used to reference a scenario in which a company (usually, a software company) uses its own product to demonstrate the quality and capabilities of the product.

Dogfooding can be a way for a company to demonstrate confidence in its own products. The idea is that if the company expects customers to buy its products, it should also be willing to use those products. Hence dogfooding can act as a kind of testimonial advertising.

One perceived advantage beyond marketing is that dogfooding allows employees to test their company's products in *real-life scenarios*, and gives management a sense of how the product will be used, all before launch to consumers.

 * Eat your own dog food; it’s good for you and makes the product better for our customers.
 * Having our own mailboxes in dog food allowed us to very quickly find functional issues that our testing may have missed and gave us confidence in the very features we were building.
 * Portion of Exchange team must be on the service dog food while the rest are on the corporate server dog food.
