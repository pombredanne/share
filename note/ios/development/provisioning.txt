 * be part of a development team
   ** roles: admins (distributor?), agents, members
   ** distributor: can send them to testers to get feedback on real-world performance.
 * add device
   ** by team admins, given device ID (UDID)
   ** up to 100 devices (each membership year), cannot regain that slot even removing some devices.
   ** the device ID must be added to a development provisioning profile (for a specific app)
 * two types of provisioning profiles (`.mobileprovision`) - development/distribution
 * development provisioning profile (also for testing)
   ** created by team admins (or agents), valid for one year.
   ** ties developers (development certificates) and devices (UDIDs) to a development team (app ID).
   ** certificates = a list of developers permitted to sign the app
   ** all team members can download it (iOS Provisioning Portal > Provisioning), then install it on devices -> provisioned devices
      *** in order to test an app, the development provisioning profile must be installed on both a Mac and the device?
      *** drag the file onto the Xcode, iTunes, or iPhone Configuration Utility app icon.
      *** If your development certificate is specified in the provisioning profile, it should show up automatically in the Devices organizer in Xcode after the provisioning profile is approved? 但 certificate 的安裝必定是手動？
   ** you can install and test apps on a device only if that device ID, app ID, and your development certificate are included in the profile.
   ** 只是要測試，也要有 development certificate 嗎？還是裝了 profile 之後，RD sign 出來的 app (`.app`?) 就可以裝了？感覺 provision profile 像是個 filter，只能裝到 profile 裡有提到的 devices，也只有用提到的 certificate 所 sign 的 app 才能裝進去。
   ** provisioning profiles created before an app ID was enabled for APNS do not work for testing APNS.
   ** a device can be added to multiple provisioning profiles.
 * distribution provisioning profile
   ** only team admins can download it, and not visible to other team members.
   ** To test an application that has been built for distribution, you need the distribution provisioning profile and the `.app` file?
 * generic develpment
   ** Xcode adds your device to the generic team provisioning profile, allows development of most (but not all) types of apps.
   ** specialized development (use push notifications or in-app purchases) -> manually configured provisioning profile (in iOS Provisioning Portal).
 * Install?
   ** 在 Organizer > LIBRARY > Provisioning Profiles 按下右下角的 Refresh 鈕就會被問 Apple ID，會自動下載 team 裡面所有的 profile。
