:title: [iOS][Dist] IPA Files

IPA (iOS App Store Package) 是一種壓縮過的檔案（compressed archive），內含 iOS app (ARM binary) 及其他。更正確地說應說是 'zipped archive'。

** An .ipa file is an iPhone application archive file which stores an iPhone app. It is usually encrypted with Apple's FairPlay DRM technology. Each .ipa file is compressed with a binary for the ARM architecture and can only be installed on an iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. Files with the .ipa extension can be uncompressed by changing the extension to .zip and unzipping.
** .ipa files cannot be installed on the iPhone Simulator because they do not contain a binary for the x86 architecture. To run applications on the simulator, original project files which can be opened using the Xcode SDK are required.
** An IPA has a built-in structure for iTunes and AppStore to recognize. the Payload folder is what contains all the app data. The iTunes Artwork file is a 512×512 pixel PNG image, containing the app's icon for showing in iTunes and the App Store app on the iPad. The iTunesMetadata.plist contains various bits of information

** An IPA file is an "archived" iOS app, a format used to distribute and install such apps for devices such as the iPhone, iPod, and iPad. In contrast to the .app files which are actually subdirectories (folders) containing the files comprising the app, an IPA file (.ipa) is a compressed archive of the app files, in ZIP format.
** In the Xcode development environment, a developer has the option to compile the app into a .app file (which includes an Intel-chip executable so the app can be run on the iOS simulator on the Mac) or an .ipa file (which doesn't include that version of the executable, so it is only runnable on real iOS devices). 為什麼 `.app` 反而可以執行在 simulator 裡，該不會發行到 App Store 的也是 `.ipa`??
** In order to install an app from an IPA file, the user also needs a Mobile Provision file, set up through the Apple developer website and cryptographically keyed to grant ability to install the app to specified users. 要拿到原始碼才能做這件事??
** In this manner, an app can be distributed by the developer to beta testers, friends, or internal users at a company, but wider public release can only be done through Apple's App Store. 很明顯地，`.ipa` 主要就是做為測試用途
** Renaming an IPA file from .ipa to .zip allows any ZIP utility to look inside it. Its structure includes a directory named Payload which contains the app itself (there's a .app file/directory beneath this), and a few more files in the root directory: iTunesArtwork (a 512 x 512 icon in PNG format), and iTunesMetadata.plist (a Property List with various information about the app).
