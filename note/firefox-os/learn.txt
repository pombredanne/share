** Just kidding, there's no developer kit. There are also no developer fees and no new programming languages to learn. You can start building apps for Firefox OS today, using nothing more than HTML, CSS and a generous helping of JavaScript.
** Using the free, widely understood languages of the web stack means that the barrier to entry for potential Firefox OS developers is very low. 關鍵就在 developer 好上手
** "It changes the economics of app development because it's cheaper to get into the game as an app developer. You don't need as many tools. You don't need to join expensive developer programs. You can start developing with what you have right now." 這是 mobile 後進的好棋，要想辦法拉攏 developer，不過好上手之外，關鍵還是在 developer 能夠賺到錢...
** The idea behind Firefox OS is simple: building apps for the mobile web using exactly the same tools and languages as the desktop web.No special APIs, no native code, no special programs or tools to "extend", "accelerate" or "optimize" HTML5 or CSS as Apple did under Steve Jobs.
** The first step in building an app for Firefox OS is determining which sort of app you want to build. There are two options; packaged apps and hosted apps. A packaged app is what it sounds like: all of your app's assets - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, manifest and so on - are packaged up in a zip file that becomes the means of distribution. A hosted application keeps all of its assets on the server and more or less functions (from the developer's viewpoint) like a website. 也就是其他平台上 native 跟 hybrid 的差別
** Both types of apps need a valid manifest file and both can be listed in the Firefox Marketplace. In the case of packaged apps you'll upload a zip file to the marketplace. Hosted apps just provide a URL and the Firefox Marketplace links to the install location.For testing reasons it's easiest to start off creating a hosted app that lives on your local network. If later you decided you'd prefer to package it up, it's not hard to convert between the two.
** A manifest file is just a simple JSON file which essentially tells Firefox OS, “hey, here's an app” and sets a few variables.
