////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** The forest root domain name is also the name of the forest.
** The forest root name is a DNS name that consists of a prefix and a suffix in the form of prefix.suffix. For example, an organization might have the forest root name corp.contoso.com. In this example, corp is the prefix and contoso.com is the suffix. Select the suffix from a list of existing names on your network. For the prefix, select a new name that has not been used on your network previously.
** By attaching a new prefix to an existing suffix, you create a unique namespace. Creating a new namespace for Active Directory ensures that any existing DNS infrastructure does not need to be modified to accommodate Active Directory.
** Contact the DNS owner for the organization for a list of registered DNS suffixes that are in use on the network that will host Active Directory.
** It is best to use DNS names that are registered with an Internet authority in the Active Directory namespace. Only registered names are guaranteed to be globally unique. If another organization later registers the same DNS domain name, or if your organization merges with, acquires, or is acquired by other company that uses the same DNS names, then the two infrastructures cannot interact with one another. 看似 root domain name 是不能改的，所以要想長遠一點。
** Using single label names or unregistered suffixes, such as .local, is not recommended.
** If you chose a registered suffix that is already in use on the network, select a prefix for the forest root domain name by using the prefix rules in Table 2.8. Add a prefix that is not currently in use to create a new subordinate name. For example, if your DNS root name is contoso.com, then you can create the Active Directory forest root domain name concorp.contoso.com, if the namespace concorp.contoso.com is not already in use on the network.
** This new branch of the namespace will be dedicated to Active Directory and can be integrated easily with the existing DNS implementation.
** If you selected a regional domain to function as a forest root domain, you might need to select a new prefix for the domain. Because the forest root domain name affects all of the other domain names in the forest, a regionally-based name might not be appropriate. For example, if Contoso Corporation decided to use their North American domain, called noam.contoso.com, as their forest root, then the European domain name would be europe.noam.contoso.com. In this case, a better choice would be to select a new prefix, such as corp, for the forest root; in this way, the name of the European domain would be europe.corp.contoso.com. 很好的例子!!
** If you are using a new suffix that is not currently in use on the network, you can use it as the forest root domain name without choosing an additional prefix. 原來 prefix 不一定需要，但多一層是比較好的??
** Avoid names such as a business line or operating system that might change in the future. Generic names such as corp or ds are recommended.
** It is important for the Active Directory DNS owner to work with the DNS owner for the organization to obtain ownership of the name that will be used for the Active Directory namespace.
