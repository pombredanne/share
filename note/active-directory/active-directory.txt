** Active Directory (AD) is a directory service created by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems.
** An AD "domain controller" authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain type network—assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software. 不只有帳號驗證的功能。
** The domain controller role was renamed Active Directory Domain Services.
** Active Directory makes use of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) versions 2 and 3
** An Active Directory structure is a hierarchical arrangement of information about objects. The objects fall into two broad categories: resources (e.g., printers) and security principals (user or computer accounts and groups). Security principals are assigned unique security identifiers (SIDs).
** Each object represents a single entity—whether a user, a computer, a printer, or a group—and its attributes. Certain objects can contain other objects.
** An object is uniquely identified by its name and has a set of attributes—the characteristics and information that the object represents— defined by a schema, which also determines the kinds of objects that can be stored in Active Directory.
** each schema object is integral to the definition of Active Directory objects. Once created, an object can only be deactivated—not deleted.
** A Site object in Active Directory represents a geographic location that hosts networks.
** The Active Directory framework that holds the objects can be viewed at a number of levels. The forest, tree, and domain are the logical divisions in an Active Directory network. 相對於 sites 的 physical divisions.
** Domain
   *** Within a deployment, objects are grouped into domains. The objects for a single domain are stored in a single database (which can be replicated). Domains are identified by their DNS name structure, the namespace.
   *** A domain is defined as a logical group of network objects (computers, users, devices) that share the same active directory database.
   *** A tree is a collection of one or more domains and domain trees in a contiguous namespace, linked in a transitive trust hierarchy. At the top of the structure is the forest. A forest is a collection of trees that share a common global catalog??, directory schema, logical structure, and directory configuration. The forest represents the security boundary within which users, computers, groups, and other objects are accessible.
