////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** dmesg (display message or driver message) is a command on most Linux- and Unix-based operating systems that prints the message buffer of the kernel.
** When the computer system is initially booted the kernel is loaded into memory. At this stage device drivers present in the kernel are set up to drive relevant hardware. Other elements within the kernel may also produce similar output reporting both the presence of that particular module, and the values of any parameters adopted. 基本上就是 kernel (drivers, modules) 吐出來的訊息。
** The dmesg command allows these messages to be reviewed in a controlled manner after the system has started.
** Even after the system has fully booted, the kernel may occasionally produce further diagnostic messages. Common examples of when this might happen are when I/O devices encounter errors, or USB devices are hot-plugged. dmesg provides a mechanism to review these messages at a later time.
** When first produced they will be directed to the system console: if the console is in use then these messages may be confused with or quickly overwritten by the output of user programs??
** Many commercial operating systems display an animated splash screen during this stage of the boot process, so the user does not see these messages. However, there is frequently a mechanism, such as the Esc key, to disable the splash screen and view the messages. This is an important diagnostic capability if the system fails to boot.
