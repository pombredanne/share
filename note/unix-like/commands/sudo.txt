 sudo - execute a command as another user

`sudo` 讓你能以另一個使用者的權限（預設是 root）執行指令。下面的指令可以切換成 root 身份：

 sudo -i

 $ sudo [-u <user_name>] <command>

如果 invoking user 是 root，或者跟 target user 是同一個人，就不會被提示要輸入密碼。

** In most distributions, there is a program that can give you temporary access to the superuser's privileges. This program is called `su` (short for substitute user) and can be used in those cases when you need to be the superuser for a small number of tasks. To become the superuser, simply type the `su` command. You will be prompted for the superuser's password.
** In some distributions, most notably Ubuntu, an alternate method is used. Rather than using `su`, these systems employ the `sudo` command instead. With `sudo`, one or more users are granted superuser privileges on an as needed basis. To execute a command as the superuser, the desired command is simply preceeded with the `sudo` command. After the command is entered, the user is prompted for the user's password rather than the superuser's. 原來 `su` 跟 `sudo` 兩者最大的差別是被提示輸入密碼時，是要輸入自己的還是 superuser 的
