////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** Both Linux / UNIX allows the data of a file to have more than one name in separate places in the same file system. Such a file with more than one name for the same data is called a hard-linked file. 不同位置的檔案共用一份資料
** A hard link to a file is indistinguishable from the original directory entry; 這裡的 "indistinguishable" 有點難解釋?? any changes to a file are effectively independent of the name used to reference the file. Hard links may not normally refer to directories and may not span file systems.
** The `ln` command make links between files. By default, `ln` makes hard links.
** 4063240 -rw-r--r-- 2 root root 15 Oct 1 15:30 bar 4063240 -rw-r--r-- 2 root root 15 Oct 1 15:30 foo 透過 `ls -i` 查看 inode number，另外其中的 2 就表示目前有幾個 file 共用這份資料
** Most modern operating systems don't allow hard links on directories to prevent endless recursion. Another drawback of hard links is that they have to be located within the same file system, and most large systems today consist of multiple file systems.
** In short, hard link is not allowed between cross devices (it does not matter if devices are formatted as ext3 or ext4). 就算兩個 disk 用相同的 filesystem，還是不能建立 hard link!!
