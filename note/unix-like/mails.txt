** Is this even actual "mail" in the same sense as email? Or is it just my system telling me something?
** It's likely to be in the spool file: `/var/mail/$USER` or `/var/spool/mail/$USER` are the most common locations on Linux and BSD. Other locations are possible – check if `$MAIL` is set – but by default, the system only informs you about `/var(/spool)/mail`.
** Usually the spool file is in a very simple 'mbox' format, so you can open it in a text editor or pager. For a slightly more convenient way, most distributions come with a program called `mail` (or Mail, `mailx`).
** Most often the messages contain output of cron jobs, or a system security report by logwatch, or similar junk.
** You should at least scan the subject headers – often people ignore the mail for months never realizing that their daily cron jobs fail. 這種狀況還沒常見的!!
** Is this even actual "mail" in the same sense as email? Or is it just my system telling me something? Yes, it's generated by your system telling you something. And yes, it's actual email, and can be handled as such. You can (and often should) configure your mail software (the "MTA": postfix, exim4, sendmail, qmail) to forward the messages to your personal address 是真實的信件，只是沒人幫忙 forward/route 到外面而已。
** (Words of advice: Don't touch the Sendmail suite (which is not to be confused with the `/usr/sbin/sendmail` program). Other MTAs such as Postfix or Exim4 are just as powerful, and much less painful.) 沒想到 sendmail 這麼惡名昭彰，那 `/usr/sbin/sendmail` 是做什麼用的??
** Just to offer some clarification, it's been the tradition for a long time for UNIX boxes to run a "locally configured" mailer daemon that doesn't route messages through the Internet, but only copies messages to other users spool directories (as @John T mentioned). It is real SMTP-compliant email, it's just not routed over the Internet because it doesn't need to be.
** You also likely have a command line utility called `mailx` that can be used to send a quick email using your shell.
** Now, if you want to send messages to users on systems other than the one you are logged in to, that's where the real fun begins. You'll need to configure your mailer daemon to recognize and hand off external email to a transfer agent
** Many system utilities will use the mail subsystem as a means of reporting and logging. Log watcher utilities and other services may send an e-mail to the local root user as a reminder about a specific event, such as low disk space or hardware errors.
