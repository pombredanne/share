                            STAF Eclipse Plug-ins

                            Getting Started Guide



   Recently an effort has begun to provide STAF interaction via the
   Eclipse Platform.  This will hopefully provide an entry point for
   beginning STAF users to get introduced to STAF via a GUI environment.
   Advanced users may find it useful as it provides access to a variety of
   information displayed in a graphical format and provides a persistent
   history of commands.  Following the spirit of Eclipse, the STAF Editor
   is extensible so that the STAF team and other users may easily add
   additional pages to the STAF Multi-Page Editor.


   Below is a list of features, steps for downloading and installing, and
   a short getting started guide.  If you have any comments or suggestions
   for improving this tool please post them to the STAF Discussion Forum.
   This is a Beta release and any input will be used to help steer the
   direction of the tool, so any and all ideas or comments are greatly
   appreciated.

   •        Submit any STAF commands via an eclipse editor

   Getting Started:


   1)       Open a STAF Perspective

   a)      Select Window -> Open Perspective -> Other

   b)      Select STAF

   c)       Click Ok

   2)       Create a STAF Project

   a)      File -> New -> STAF Project

   b)      Enter desired project name

   c)       Click Finish

   3)       Create a STAF Machine Group (optional) - STAF Machines (next
   step) may exist without a group

   a)      File -> New -> Machine Group

   b)      Select the STAF project created above as the container

   c)       Enter desired Group Name

   d)      Click Finish

   4)       Create a STAF Machine

   a)      File -> New -> Machine

   b)      Select the STAF Machine Group or STAF Project as the container

   c)       Enter the Hostname of the desired machine (this machine must
   be running STAF)

   d)      Optionally enter the interface and/or port needed to
   communicate with the machine.  In most circumstances, these items may
   be left as the "Local Default" in which case STAF will perform the
   standard interface cycling when attempting to establish communication
   with the machine.

   e)      Click Finish

   5)       Open the STAF Editor for the newly created Machine

   a)      Double-click the newly created machine in the STAF view (left
   panel of Eclipse)

   b)      NOTE: STAF must be running on the local machine and on the
   remote machine

   c)       Use the editor to interact with STAF on remote machines

   6)       The STAF Editor is an Eclipse Multi-Page Editor with 2 static
   pages with dynamically loaded pages based on the installed plug-ins and
   currently running services on the given STAF endpoint.

   a)      The main editor page, "STAF Editor" contains three sections or
   sashes that may be resized:

   i)         Command Submission - This sash contains some basic
   information about the STAF endpoint and widgets to submit STAF
   commands.  All commands submitted from this section will appear in the
   "Command History".

   ii)       Command History - This sash contains the history of commands
   submitted via the STAF Editor.  This information is persisted when the
   editor is saved.  Double-clicking an entry will populate its data in
   the "Command Submission" widgets for re-submission or editing.

   iii)      Command Results - When a command that has completed is
   selected in the "Command History" table its result data will appear in
   this section.  The type of widget used to display the data will be
   dynamically created based upon the format of the result data.

   b)      The "Properties" page allows the hostname, port, and interface
   of the STAF endpoint to be modified.  It also allows mappings between
   service names and STAF Editor extensions to be created.  However, this
   functionality is currently moot as extensions have thus far only been
   created for internal services.

   c)       The Beta release contains extensions for a few of the standard
   STAF internal services (HANDLE, SERVICE, TRUST, VAR).  These pages may
   be used to retrieve data from the service and in some instances modify
   data or settings on the service.

   i)         HANDLE – The Handle service extension displays current
   handle information.  The types of handles displayed may be filtered
   using the checkboxes at the top of the page.  Use the refresh button to
   retrieve updated information from STAF.

   ii)       SERVICE – The Service service extension displays information
   about registered services and current requests.  This information is
   separated into two tabs, Requests & Services.  Select an item from the
   list to display detailed information.  Use the refresh button to
   retrieve updated information from STAF.

   iii)      TRUST – The Trust service extension displays and allows
   modification of STAF trust settings.  The input widgets at the top of
   the page may be used to add new trust settings.  Double click an entry
   in the table to populate its information into the input widgets.  Use
   the refresh button to retrieve updated information from STAF.

   iv)     VAR – The Var service extension displays and allows
   modification of STAF variables.  The input widgets at the top of the
   page may be used to add or update variables.  Double click an entry in
   the table to populate its information into the input widgets.  Use the
   refresh button to retrieve updated information from STAF.  The bottom
   section of the page may be used to test STAF variable resolutions.
   Enter the text to resolve in the left text pane, click “Resolves To ->”
   button and the resolved string is displayed in the right text pane.
