   Welcome to STAF

   The Software Testing Automation Framework (STAF) is an open source,
   multi-platform, multi-language framework designed around the idea of
   reusable components, called services (such as process invocation,
   resource management, logging, and monitoring). STAF removes the tedium
   of building an automation infrastructure, thus enabling you to focus on
   building your automation solution. The STAF framework provides the
   foundation upon which to build higher level solutions, and provides a
   pluggable approach supported across a large variety of platforms and
   languages.

   STAF can be leveraged to help solve common industry problems, such as
   more frequent product cycles, less preparation time, reduced testing
   time, more platform choices, more programming language choices, and
   increased National Language requirements. STAF can help in these areas
   since it is a proven and mature technology, promotes automation and
   reuse, has broad platform and language support, and provides a common
   infrastructure across teams.

   STAX is an execution engine which can help you thoroughly automate the
   distribution, execution, and results analysis of your testcases. STAX
   builds on top of three existing technologies, STAF, XML, and Python, to
   place great automation power in the hands of testers. STAX also
   provides a powerful monitoring application which allows you to interact
   with and monitor the progress of your jobs. Some of the main features
   of STAX are: support for parallel execution, user-defined granularity
   of execution control, support for nested testcases, the ability to
   control the length of execution time, the ability to import modules at
   run-time, support for existing Python and Java modules and packages,
   and the ability to extend both the STAX language as well as the STAX
   monitoring application. Using these capabilities, you can build
   sophisticated scripts to automate your entire test environment, while
   ensuring maximum efficiency and control.

   Other STAF services are also provided to help you to create an
   end-to-end automation solution. By using these services in your test
   cases and automated solutions, you can develop more robust, dynamic
   test cases and test environments.

   We encourage the community to post patches, new features, new STAF
   services, etc. that enhance or extend the STAF project. Please see
   Making Contributions to STAF for more information on how to do this.

   Also, feel free to post a question via one of our discussion forums or
   mailing lists. These are also good places to search for answers to
   questions, in addition to the FAQ, STAF User Guide, STAX User Guide,
   and other documentation.

   Note that eWeek.com ran an article in 2007 about the most important
   open-source applications. At the end they invited readers to write in
   letting them know about applications they missed. Then they ran an
   article containing the ones most often mentioned and their readers said
   STAF was one of the most important open-source applications. See the
   full article here. This slide is about STAF.

   Also, SDTimes.com ran an article on July 22, 2008 that put STAF at the
   top of its list of open source tools for Automated Testing. See the
   Functional Testing Tools, the Open-Source Wave article.
