Syslog is a standard for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_logging[logging program messages]. __It allows separation of the software that generates messages from the system that stores them and the software that reports and analyzes them.__ It also provides devices, which would otherwise be unable to communicate, a means to notify administrators of problems or performance. (指 Devices 可以將 Messages 送到提供有 Syslog 服務的系統, 間接通知到系統管理者)

Syslog can be used for computer system management and ''security auditing'' as well a generalized informational, analysis and debugging messages. __It is supported by a wide variety of devices (like printers and routers) and ''receivers'' (指 Syslog 伺服器) across multiple platforms. Because of this, syslog can be used to integrate log data from many different types of systems into a ''central repository''.__

Messages refer to a facility (`auth`, `authpriv`, `daemon`, `cron`, `ftp`, `lpr`, `kern`, `mail`, `news`, `syslog`, `user`, `uucp`, `local0`, ... , `local7`)

and are assigned a priority/level (Emergency, Alert, Critical, Error, Warning, Notice, Info or Debug) by the sender of the message.

__Configuration allows directing messages to various local devices (console), files (`/var/log/`) or remote syslog deamons.__ Care must be taken when updating the configuration as omitting or misdirecting message `facility.level` can cause important messages to be ignored by syslog or overlooked by the administrator.

__`logger` is a command line utility that can send messages to the syslog.__

Some implementations permit the filtering and display of syslog messages.

Syslog is now standardized within the http://www.employees.org/~lonvick/index.shtml[Syslog working group of the IETF].
