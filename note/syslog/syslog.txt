** Syslog is a standard for computer message logging. It permits separation of the software that generates messages from the system that stores them and the software that reports and analyzes them. 重點在這裡!!
** It is supported by a wide variety of devices (like printers and routers) and receivers across multiple platforms. Because of this, syslog can be used to integrate log data from many different types of systems into a central repository. 有人產生 logs，有人接收 logs。
** Messages are labeled with a facility code (one of: auth, authpriv, daemon, cron, ftp, lpr, kern, mail, news, syslog, user, uucp, local0 ... local7) indicating the type of software that generated the messages, and are assigned a severity (one of: Emergency, Alert, Critical, Error, Warning, Notice, Info, Debug). 其中 facility code 指哪種類型的 application/device 發出這個 log，但 severity 好像從結果看不出來??
** Implementations are available for many operating systems. Specific configuration may permit directing messages to various devices (console), files (/var/log/) or remote syslog servers. 系統本身有 syslog 的服務，可以寫到本地端檔案，也可以端到另一台 syslog server??
** Most implementations also provide a command line utility, often called `logger`, that can send messages to the syslog. Some implementations permit the filtering and display of syslog messages. 所以看 syslog 正確的方法應該是透過 tools，而不是用 grep 或 tail 硬幹??
** Syslog was developed in the 1980s by Eric Allman as part of the Sendmail project, and was initially used solely for Sendmail. 沒想到會是出自 sendmail
** Syslog has since become the standard logging solution on Unix and Unix-like systems; there have also been a variety of syslog implementations on other operating systems and is commonly found in network devices such as routers.
** Syslog functioned as a de facto standard, without any authoritative published specification, and many implementations existed, some of which were incompatible. The Internet Engineering Task Force documented the status quo in RFC 3164. It was made obsolete by subsequent additions in RFC 5424
** Syslog has proven to be an effective format to consolidate logs, as there are many open source and proprietary tools for reporting and analysis. Converters exist from Windows Event Log as well as other log formats to syslog. 目的是為了讓 logs 集中到 syslog server??
** A facility level is used to specify what type of program is logging the message. This lets the configuration file specify that messages from different facilities will be handled differently. 至少可以將不同 facility 的 logs 導到不同檔案。
** Syslog is a client/server protocol: a logging application transmits a maximum 1024-byte text message to the syslog receiver. The receiver is commonly called syslogd, syslog daemon or syslog server. Syslog messages may be sent via the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Syslog uses the port number 514. 走 UDP 會掉吧??
** The data is sent in cleartext; although not part of the syslog protocol itself, an SSL wrapper may be used to provide for a layer of encryption through SSL/TLS.
