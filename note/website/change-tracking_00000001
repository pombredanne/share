=== Five of The Best Free Uptime Monitoring Tools for Developers (2008/05/31) ===
http://blog.webdistortion.com/2008/05/31/five-of-the-best-free-uptime-monitoring-tools/ @2008/10/27

Many clients often ask how to go about monitoring how available their website is, and their are many useful tools online for doing just that. If you’re an online business your profit line depends on how available your website is to your audience, and if you are a blogger like moi- well then you may want to know just how accurate that 99.9% uptime statement from your web host really is. I received an email through from http://www.michaelwall.co.uk/[Michael @ Codefixer] today, letting me know he was experiencing problems with my blog, so the following post is going to summarise some of the better free monitoring tools I found on my pursuits(追蹤) of website happiness.

'''http://www.basicstate.com/[BasicState](*)'''

The first - basicstate.com offers an extremely easy way to monitor your site - and whilst the design of their own site leaves much to be desired, (they are still stuck in the 90’s with that dark background) the service itself is free to use and reliable. Once you are logged in you are presented with an account management page that allows you to add (numerous) new sites to your account. I managed to successfully add 5 sites to the system, but I the number of websites you can monitor is limitless. The reports generated from Basic State arrive in your email program on a daily basis, and there are also uptime monitoring graphs available once you login to the system. __The uptime monitoring service monitors http and https services every 15 minutes for ''unlimited number of sites''.__ The summary below shows what arrives in your inbox. The service is however limit to just HTTP (and HTTPS) requests i.e. just monitors web pages.

'''http://www.serviceuptime.com/[ServiceUptime]'''

ServiceUptime offers two services - the free and premium versions of its uptime monitoring service. They do also give access to a number of alternative ports to monitor. For example if you wish to detect when your mail server goes down - no problem. Service uptime can monitor smtp, imap and pop servers. They also allow checking of links, (extremely useful for detecting if a backlink to your site remains in place), https (for secure pages), dns, mysql or any tcp or ssl port that you wish to specify - all for free. __The Free account monitors ''1 service'' from 4 monitoring location at the frequency of 30 or 60 minutes with email alerts.__

'''http://www.montastic.com/[Montastic](*)'''

Montastic offers a friendly little service, with a few added features such as RSS feeds of website availability and ''Ajax postbacks'' on its own site. The service is simple to find your way around - in fact im not even going to post the signup URL on this one, as it is on the home page. There is a maximum number of servers that you can monitor (100) but this is just a small stipulation(條件). Monitoring is performed every 10 minutes at a minimum. They do also try to do a bit of email marketing to their users, so watch out for that in the signup process.

'''http://www.servermojo.com/[Mon.itor.US](*)'''

To start with - brilliant(出色的) domain, going with that olde del.icio.us web 2.0 feel. The site also doesn’t disappoint visually. As per serviceuptime, mon.itor.us offers some alternative reports and ports to monitor, including but not limited to https, ftp, sip, any TCP, any UDP, (Mail servers IMAP, SMTP and POP) and DNS. The interface is similar to http://www.pageflakes.com/[pageflakes], allowing you to add “modules of monitoring” which is cool. They too offer RSS feeds of monitoring stats ,simply add your site, and the RSS module which will give you a link to paste into your feed reader.

== Web Page Change Detection ==

 * @2008/10/22 目前使用下來, Change Detection 與 Pagehammer 的效果都還不錯. 只是網站或文件的數量龐大時不好管理. 可以用 `lynx -dump "source_url" > local_archive` 保存下來供日後比對.

 * @2008/10/24 調整做法 - 將文件搜集在 Scrapbook, 哪怕是看過的部份. 需要更新時再用 `lynx` 對 Scrapbook 存下來的版本做比對即可. 如此可以避免 wiki 存放一堆沒用的檔案...

 * @2008/11/26 發現線上的服務很適合用來 "即時掌握" 資訊, 但不適合用來 "更新" 資訊. 就拿 Maven 來說, 持續通知 Maven 頁面的變化, 讓我們即時掌握版本的變化, 至於文件的內容, 幾次通知下來可能就麻痺了, 因為我們沒有那麼多時間去更新我們看過的文件. 通常都是過了一段時間之後, 要複習某些文件時才需要檢查是否產生變化. 因此回到最初的想法, 反而 `lynx -dump` 的做法是最實際的...

 * @2009/03/31 遇到舊文件沒有用 `lynx -dump` 留存時, 可以比對 http://www.archive.org/index.php[archive.org] 的庫存頁面, 做為比對的依據. (可惜它不支援 https:// 協定)

 * @2009/04/06 只需要針對可能會變動的文章做備存, 例如 Wiki、網站內容等. 新聞報導等固定不變的文件則不需要做這個動作... (保存 URL 即可)

=== Monitoring changes to web pages ===
http://www.rba.co.uk/sources/monitor.htm

It is difficult enough tracking down relevant and useful sites, but keeping up with changes to the pages is an impossible task when you have more than a a dozen or so to monitor. Link checkers such as Xenu Link Sleuth (http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html) can alert you to pages that have disappeared or that are redirecting users to another site, but changes to the content are equally if not more important.

There are many services that monitor web page content for changes. Some are free whilst(然而) other priced services may offer limited facilities as a free taster.

This review looks at two types of services: web based services and software programs for PCs and Intranets.

==== Web based services ====

 * __@2008/10/08 實驗發現 Change Detection 與 Pagehammer 各有優缺點, 前者可以直接在網頁上標出異動之處, 但可惜它不能像 Pagehammer 一樣做頁面的分組, 頁面眾外時會難以管理, 後者則剛好跟 Change Detection 相反. '''因此 Change Detection 比較適合用在首頁的監測, 用以掌握最新消息的發佈, 而 Pagehammer 則比較適合用在文件細部異動的監測 (相關的文件集合在一起, 會比較好管理).'''__

 * @2008/11/23 頁面數量多到一定程式之後, Pagehammer 也難以招架. 最好的方式就是用 WebSec 架設自己的服務. 如果可以跟 Wiki 裡標示的來源位址做整合的話, 就太完美了.

'''Change Detection(*)'''

URL: http://www.changedetection.com/

__This is a free service allowing you to monitor an ''unlimited number of pages''.__ The frequency of the alerts can be daily, weekly or monthly and you can choose to only have alerts for "sizeable changes", when content has been added or removed, or for specific keywords. The email merely alerts you to the fact that there have been changes; you have to click on a link in the email to view them in the Change Detection web site.

{{attachment:changedetection_summary.png}} <<BR>> 雖然信件通知上不會說明異動的細節, 但所有的異動在網路上都有被記錄下來

{{attachment:changedetection_compare.png}} <<BR>> 直接在網頁上標出異動, 版本之間也可以做比對

'''ChangeDetect'''

URL: http://www.changedetect.com/

The free trial version of this service allows you to monitor a maximum of 5 pages a week and marks web page text for you with color-coded highlights of what has changed. The free trial lasts(持續) for two weeks. You can receive web page change notifications via your email, pager, ICQ or text messaging. The subscription services allow you to monitor more pages and password protected pages. ChangeDetect Personal costs USD 1.95 a month and monitors 10 web pages. ChangeDetect Plus costs USD 14.95 a month for 100 web pages and allows you to set up keyword and phrase notification triggers. ChangeDetect Professional costs USD 39.95 a month for 500 web pages with content checked twice-daily.

'''ChangeNotes'''

URL: http://www.changenotes.com/

Free service that monitors up to a hundred pages and emails changes to you.

'''Feedwhip'''

URL: http://www.feedwhip.com/

Free service that alerts you of changes by email or RSS. The free Basic service only allows you three page monitors and the free 'upgrade' to BasicPlus limits you to ten.

'''FollowThatPage'''

URL: http://www.followthatpage.com/

The free service provides 100 daily page checks and 1 hourly check. You can monitor additions, deletions, ''Google page rank'', keywords, and sections of a page. Alerts are sent to you by email. They say they are working on a paid version of their service that can monitor 1000 pages per day and 50 pages per hour per user.

'''Infominder'''

URL: http://www.infominder.com/

Tracks up to 10 pages free of charge and allows you to associate categories and descriptions with a "minder". Within the advanced options you can specify how often, in days, the page is to be checked. The most frequent allowed for free is every 1 day. You can also specify the minimum number of changes that must occur before you are notified and any keywords or phrases that must appear in the changes.

Infominder Professional, which checks for page changes once a day, costs from USD 30/yr for 100 minders to USD 250/yr for 1000 minders. The Premium version checks pages 4 times a day and prices range from USD 65/yr for 100 pages to USD 500/yr for 1000 pages.

The email notification includes the number of changes that have occurred, the number of characters that have changed and the altered text. There is a link to the Infominder page where you can view a copy of the page with the changes highlighted.

Although the prices have been 'updated' on the site, the repeated reference to support for Netscape Navigator in the FAQs and other pages and no reference to Firefox does not inspire confidence in this service and suggests that its owners have put it on the backburner(不重要的).

'''Page2RSS'''

URL: http://page2rss.com

Page2RSS monitors web pages for changes and notifies you of those changes by RSS. Simply type in the URL of the page you wish to monitor and then add the feed URL to your favourite feed reader. Excellent tool for pages that do not offer their own RSS feeds.

'''Pagehammer(*)'''

URL: http://www.pagehammer.com/

__Free service that allows you to monitor channels, or groups of web pages, containing similar content or ''pages from one particular web site''.__ Each channel can have different monitoring frequencies (twice daily, daily, twice a week or weekly). You can also specify for each page keywords and phrases that are to be specifically monitored or excluded. The email alerts send you new or changed text and also text that has been deleted.

{{attachment:pagehammer_sample.png}} <<BR>> 網頁內容的變更除了可以從 Email 接收到以外, 網站上也提供歷史記錄可以查詢; 但兩者都只分別列出 Additions and Changes 及 Deleted 兩大區塊, 沒有像 Change Detection 一樣直接在網頁上做標示.

'''Track Engine'''

URL: http://www.trackengine.com/

The free part of this service, which is limited to 5 pages, is a demonstration for the priced version. For each page you can set up an easy to remember name or description and the monitoring frequency (daily, 2 days, 3 days or weekly). The advanced options enable you to select the colour for highlighting the changes on the monitored page, and to track changes to hyperlinks, images, numbers and dates as well as the text. You can request alerts for changes that include specified words or phrases and tell it to ignore certain changes. You can even monitor pages that are password protected by supplying Track Engine with your user name and password. You can upgrade to "Big Breakfast", which costs US $4.95 a month for 50 bookmarks, or to "Just Coffee" at US $19.95 a year for 10 bookmarks.

'''Watch That Page(*)'''

URL: http://www.watchthatpage.com/

This is a free service run by ATS Consulting, a Norwegian company that specialises in software development. You can monitor an unlimited number of pages, which can be grouped into folders and monitored on a daily or weekly basis. There is a keyword matching option that filters the changes that are relevant to you, for example if you are only looking for news where a certain term or phrase occurs such as a company or a product name. Channels enable you to divide your pages into groups based on importance or content type. Each channel can have different properties: some can have keyword matching and daily reports whilst others can be checked less frequently and report all changes. Email alerts can include the text that has changed on your pages or just list the URLs of pages that have changed. __If you are a professional or heavy user, you are required to pay a fee. Watchthatpage will notify you by email if you fall into the heavy user category.__

== WebSec ==

=== Official Home ===
http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/websec/

'''What is WebSec?'''

Web Secretary is a web page change monitoring software. __It will detect changes based on content analysis, making sure that it's not just HTML that changed, but ''actual content''.__ You can tell it what to ignore in the page (hit counters and such), and it can mail you the document with the ''changes highlighted'' or load the highlighted page in a browser.

__Web Secretary is actually a suite of two Perl scripts called `websec` and `webdiff`. (下達 `sudo apt-get install websec` 即可安裝完成) `websec` retrieves web pages and email them to you based on a ''URL list'' that you provide. `webdiff` compares two web pages (current and archive) and creates a new page based on the current page but with all the differences highlighted using a predefined color.__

For example you can look at the Web Secretary page as it was monitored:

 * http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/websec/websec-homepage.old.html[Old Page] - The original page before the change.
 * http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/websec/websec-homepage.new.html[Modified Page] - The page after the change.
 * http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/websec/websec-homepage.highlighted.html[Highlighted Page] - The page as WebSec sends, highlighted.

__Personally, I put Web Secretary on `crontab` to monitor a large number of web pages. When the highlighted pages are delivered to me,__ I use http://www.procmail.org/[procmail] to sort them out(分揀) and file them into another folder. Sometimes, when I am busy, I will not have time to accessing the web for a few days. However, with Web Secretary, I can always access the "archive" that it has created for me at my own leisure(空閒).

The man pages can be found online: http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/websec/websec(1).html[websec(1)], http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/websec/url.list(5).html[url.list(5)], http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/websec/ignore.list(5).html[ignore.list(5)], http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/websec/webdiff(1).html[webdiff(1)].

'''How to use?'''

__Just run the program and it will do its magic, the best mode would be to put it in a cron job for automatic daily work, this is great if you are connected all the time.__

If you are connected by dial-up, you may want to make it run automatically upon connection, how to do this is different between OSes & Distributions so exact instructions you will need to find on your own.

If you want to have different sites checked at different intervals you can check the way Jani Uusitalo made http://www.mummila.net/varasto/tekstit/websec-cron.html[an advanced setup for websec and cron].

'''Competitors'''

Maybe you are not happy with Web Secretary (please tell me why!), or maybe you want to look at other options, it's a Free-Software world(!) after-all. Following is a list of programs I've found that are somewhat related to what WebSec does.

 * http://kwebwatch.sourceforge.net/[KWebWatch]

   .Based on Web Secretary, but written in C++ and with a KDE GUI. Has renewed development and offers a KDE3 user interface.

 * http://www.antbear.org/urlchange/urlprj.html[urlchange]

   .Checks only timestamps and not actual page changes. It's main advantages is being written in Python.

 * http://sourceforge.net/projects/wrep/[wrep]

   .A program to extract with regular expression interesting parts of pages, doesn't check for changes, it simply extracts interesting parts. There appears to be two wrep's, from two different authors, with totally different methods of work.

 * http://lab.madscience.nl/wrep/[WebReporter]

   .A language to http://cdict.net/q/munge[munge(轉換資料)] webpages into something else, can be used to create a summary page out of changes from other sites.
