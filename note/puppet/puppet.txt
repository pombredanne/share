////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** Puppet is an open source configuration management tool from Puppet Labs, founded by Luke Kanies in 2005. It is written in Ruby. 沒想到 Ruby 也可以做這麼系統層級的事。
** Puppet is a tool designed to manage the configuration of Unix-like and Microsoft Windows systems declaratively. The user describes system resources and their state, either using Puppet's declarative language or a Ruby DSL (domain-specific language). This information is stored in files called "Puppet manifests". Puppet discovers the system information via a utility called Facter??, and compiles the Puppet manifests into a system-specific catalog containing resources and resource dependency, which are applied against the target systems. 又是一層 abstraction
** and the agent uses system specific providers to enforce the resource specified in the manifests. The resource abstraction layer enables administrators to describe the configuration in high-level terms, such as users, services and packages without the need to specify OS specific commands (such as `rpm`, `yum`, `apt`).
** Built to be cross-platform, it works on Linux distributions, including CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Mandriva, Oracle Linux, RHEL, Scientific Linux, SUSE and Ubuntu, as well as multiple Unix systems (Solaris, BSD, Mac OS X, AIX, HP-UX), and has Microsoft Windows support. 沒想到 Windows 也支援，但程度有不同吧??
