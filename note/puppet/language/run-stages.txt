 * https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib[Puppet Labs Standard Library (puppetlabs/stdlib)] - `stdlib::stages` 宣告了幾個 custom stages: `setup` -> `main` -> `runtime` -> `setup_infra` -> ... 最常用的是跑在 `main` 之前的 `setup`，可以用來設定 package repo。

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** Run stages are an additional way to order resources. They allow groups of classes to run before or after nearly everything else, without having to explicitly create relationships with every other class. 把多個 resources 分組，再設定組別之間套用的順序
** The run stage feature has two parts: A `stage` resource type. A `stage` metaparameter, which assigns a class to a named run stage.
** By default there is only one stage (named “`main`”). All resources are automatically associated with this stage unless explicitly assigned to a different one. 這就是 log 裡會看到 `Info: /Stage[main]/...` 的關係
** Additional stages are declared as normal resources. Each additional stage must have an order relationship with another stage, such as `Stage['main']`. As with normal resources, these relationships can be specified with metaparameters or with chaining arrows. `stage { 'first': before => Stage['main'], } stage { 'last': } Stage['main'] -> Stage['last']` 這裡 chaining arrows 的用法還滿特別的。
** Once stages have been declared, a class may be assigned to a custom stage with the `stage` metaparameter.
** In order to assign a class to a stage, you must use the resource-like class declaration syntax. You cannot assign classes to stages with the `include` function.
** You cannot subscribe to or notify resources across a stage boundary. 複雜的 config 很容易被絆住...
** Due to the “anchor pattern issue” with containment, classes that declare other classes will behave badly if declared with a run stage??
** Due to these limitations, stages should only be used with the simplest of classes, and only when absolutely necessary. Mass dependencies like package repositories are effectively the only valid use case. 把某些事情提到 `Stage['main']` 之前做，如果明確從 `Stage['main']` 被 require，反而會出錯
