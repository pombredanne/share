** Late to the game, I know, but there is also WebScarab which is a free Java web proxy similar to Fiddler.
** You could run Fiddler on a different machine and set that as your HTTP proxy; this way, it doesn't matter on what OS your app runs. As MarkR notes, "different machine" can also mean "inside a VM."
** There is another Java application that aims to do what Fiddler does called Paros. Runs in Linux and Windows, etc.

** FWIW, you can, of course, just use Fiddler on a Windows PC and point the Mac/Linux box at it. 這方法不錯，但就是要跑一個 VM。
** Zaproxy, a fork of Paros, is a cross-platform open source debugging proxy and is actively maintained under OWASP.
** Wireshark won't help you if you have to debug HTTPS requests (unless you can get the encryption keys for both endpoints - see the Wireshark site for details).
** I'd recommend giving Parosproxy a try. It is a Java application serving as a http(s) proxy; although it seems to be no longer under active development, it provides quite a lot of features and proved to be very helpful to me in the past.
** If you limit yourself to Firefox, the Tamper Data extension is pretty solid.
** Paros works like a charm for me on my Ubuntu Jaunty x64. Just as simple as download, run, set proxy settings in browser to localhost:8080 and you are ready to inspect your http browsing.
** I prefer this to firefox plugin because I can use it with different browsers and software.
** There are a number of Chrome store apps now. I'm using "Dev HTTP Client" now.
