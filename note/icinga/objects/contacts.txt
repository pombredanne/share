////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** Contacts are people involved in the notification process:
   *** Contacts have one or more notification methods (cellphone, pager, email, instant messaging, etc.)
   *** Contacts receive notifications for hosts and service they are responsible for 依權責劃分!!

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** A contact definition is used to identify someone who should be contacted in the event of a problem on your network.
** `contact_name`: This directive is used to define a short name used to identify the contact. It is referenced in contact group definitions. Under the right circumstances, the `$CONTACTNAME$` macro will contain this value.
** `alias`: This directive is used to define a longer name or description for the contact. Under the rights circumstances, the `$CONTACTALIAS$` macro will contain this value. If not specified, the contact_name will be used as the alias.
** `contactgroups`: This directive is used to identify the short name(s) of the contactgroup(s) that the contact belongs to. Multiple contactgroups should be separated by commas. This directive may be used as an alternative to (or in addition to) using the `members` directive in contactgroup definitions.
** `host_notifications_enabled`: This directive is used to determine whether or not the contact will receive notifications about host problems and recoveries. Values: 0 = don't send notifications, 1 = send notifications.
** `service_notifications_enabled`: This directive is used to determine whether or not the contact will receive notifications about service problems and recoveries. Values: 0 = don't send notifications, 1 = send notifications.
** `host_notification_period`: This directive is used to specify the short name of the time period during which the contact can be notified about host problems or recoveries. You can think of this as an "on call" time for host notifications for the contact.
** `service_notification_period`: This directive is used to specify the short name of the time period during which the contact can be notified about service problems or recoveries. You can think of this as an "on call" time for service notifications for the contact.
** `host_notification_commands`: This directive is used to define a list of the short names of the commands used to notify the contact of a host problem or recovery. Multiple notification commands should be separated by commas. All notification commands are executed when the contact needs to be notified. The maximum amount of time that a notification command can run is controlled by the notification_timeout option. 看似 notification commands 只能從單一個 contact 設定??
** `host_notification_options`: This directive is used to define the host states for which notifications can be sent out to this contact. Valid options are a combination of one or more of the following: d = notify on DOWN host states, u = notify on UNREACHABLE host states, r = notify on host recoveries (UP states), f = notify when the host starts and stops flapping, and s = send notifications when host or service scheduled downtime starts and ends. If you specify n (none) as an option, the contact will not receive any type of host notifications.
** `service_notification_options`: This directive is used to define the service states for which notifications can be sent out to this contact. Valid options are a combination of one or more of the following: w = notify on WARNING service states, u = notify on UNKNOWN service states, c = notify on CRITICAL service states, r = notify on service recoveries (OK states), and f = notify when the service starts and stops flapping. If you specify n (none) as an option, the contact will not receive any type of service notifications.
** `service_notification_commands`: This directive is used to define a list of the short names of the commands used to notify the contact of a service problem or recovery. Multiple notification commands should be separated by commas. All notification commands are executed when the contact needs to be notified. The maximum amount of time that a notification command can run is controlled by the notification_timeout option.
** `email`: This directive is used to define an email address for the contact. Depending on how you configure your notification commands, it can be used to send out an alert email to the contact. Under the right circumstances, the `$CONTACTEMAIL$` macro will contain this value.
** `pager`: This directive is used to define a pager number for the contact. It can also be an email address to a "pager gateway" (i.e. pagejoe@pagenet.com). 如果最後送往哪裡是裡 notification_commands 決定，為什麼還要分 `email` 跟 `pager`??
   *** Depending on how you configure your notification commands, it can be used to send out an alert page to the contact. Under the right circumstances, the `$CONTACTPAGER$` macro will contain this value.
** A contact group definition is used to group one or more contacts together for the purpose of sending out alert/recovery notifications.
** `contactgroup_name`: This directive is a short name used to identify the contact group.
** `alias`: This directive is used to define a longer name or description used to identify the contact group.
** `members`: This directive is used to define a list of the short names of contacts that should be included in this group. Multiple contact names should be separated by commas. This directive may be used as an alternative to (or in addition to) using the contactgroups directive in contact definitions.
** `contactgroup_members`: This optional directive can be used to include contacts from other "sub" contact groups in this contact group. Specify a comma-delimited list of short names of other contact groups whose members should be included in this group.
