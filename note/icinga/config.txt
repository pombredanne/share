** Be patient! Configuring Icinga can take quite a while, especially if you're first-time user. Once you figure out how things work, it'll all be well worth your time. :-) 一堆 terms!!
** Names and locations of these configuration files are all up to you but it is commonly accepted to have files called `icinga.cfg`, `resource.cfg`, and `cgi.cfg` in the main config directory (通常是 `/etc/icinga`).
** The names of the object definition files may show the type of definitions (`contacts.cfg`, `commands.cfg`, `timeperiods.cfg`, `notifications.cfg`), the type of hardware (`printer.cfg`, `switch.cfg`), or the object which is described (`localhost.cfg`).
** the files may be in separate folders per geographical location (country, branch, ...) and a file per physical or logical unit (room, rack, application, development, ...), or the concept which seems to suit your needs best. 依適合自己的方式劃分 folders
** The main configuration file contains a number of directives that affect how the Icinga daemon operates and links to several other files. This config file is read by both the Icinga daemon and the CGIs. (`cgi.cfg` 裡可以指定 `main_config_file`)
** Resource files can be used to store user-defined macros (可以代換文字，用起來像是變數?? resource files 該不會只是用來定義 macros 而已吧??). The main point of having resource files is to use them to store sensitive configuration information (like passwords), without making them available to the CGIs. 聽起來，就算是走 CGI，背後也是轉給 Icinga daemon 處理??
** Object definition files are used to define hosts, services, hostgroups, contacts, contactgroups, commands, etc. This is where you define all the things you want to monitor and how you want to monitor them. You can specify one or more object definition files by using the `cfg_file` and/or `cfg_dir` directives in your main configuration file, but it is advisable to stick to one type of directive (either `cfg_dir` or `cfg_file` until you understand the implications using both at a time). 看來 object definitions 會是最花時間的部份!! 注意 `cgf_file` 或 `cfg_dir` 只跟 object definition files 有關。
** Your object definition files can in turn include other files using the `include_file` or `include_dir` directives. These can only occur outside of the actual object definitions, and behave very much like the `cfg_file=` and `cfg_dir=` directives in the main configuration file. 在實務上很少用，因為 `cfg_dir` 自然就會將 `*.cfg` 納進來。
** The CGI configuration file contains a number of directives that affect the operation of the CGIs. It also contains a reference to the main configuration file, so the CGIs know how you've configured Icinga and where your object definitions are stored.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** When creating and/or editing configuration files, keep the following in mind:
   *** Lines that start with a '#' character are taken to be comments and are not processed 但如果 `#` 出現在中間就不算??
   *** Variables names must begin at the start of the line - no white space is allowed before the name
   *** Variable names are case-sensitive
** This is used to specify an optional resource file that can contain `$USERn$` macro definitions. `$USERn$` macros are useful for storing usernames, passwords, and items commonly used in command definitions (like directory paths). 如果 macro 只能取名 `$USERn$` 就太糟了??
** The CGIs will not attempt to read resource files, so you can set restrictive permissions (600 or 660) on them to protect sensitive information.
** You can include multiple resource files by adding multiple `resource_file` statements to the main config file - Icinga will process them all.
