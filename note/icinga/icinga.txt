** Icinga takes open source monitoring to the next level
** Icinga is an enterprise grade open source monitoring system which keeps watch over networks and any conceivable (想得到的) network resource, notifies the user of errors and recoveries and generates performance data for reporting. Scalable and extensible, Icinga can monitor complex, large environments across dispersed locations. 這裡 "errors and recoveries" 指的應該就是 state 的變化??
** Icinga is a fork of Nagios and is backward compatible. So, Nagios configurations, plugins and addons can all be used with Icinga. 原來 Icinga 是從 Nagios 分出來的!!

** Icinga is an open source network and computer system monitoring application. It was originally created as a fork of the Nagios system monitoring application in 2009.
** a REST API that lets administrators integrate numerous extensions without complicated modification of the Icinga core. 這是很多管理工具要進到 enterprise 必須具備的功能
** The Icinga developers also seek to reflect community needs more closely and to integrate patches more quickly.
** Icinga was included by Jeffrey Hammond of Forrester Research in a list of "waxing" (as opposed to "waning") open source projects based on its rate of commits.
** In May 2009, a group of developers from the Nagios community announced the fork Icinga, citing their dissatisfaction with the stagnant development of the Nagios software at the time and their desire to open its development to a broader base. 好好的，為什麼會趨緩？
** In their third year, Icinga celebrated their 100,000th download, integrated the Icinga API component into Icinga Web; improved SLA reporting; opened an official Freenode IRC group and extended the Icinga virtual appliances to Debian, OpenSUSE and CentOS.
** In October 2012, the Icinga project released a technology preview of a core framework replacement and parallel development branch, Icinga 2. 原來 Icinga 2 是 2012 才提出，還算很新...
** distributed systems for redundant monitoring. 什麼是 redundant monitoring??
** Icinga also maintains configuration and plug-in compatibility with Nagios, facilitating migration between the two monitoring software.
** Simple plug-in design that allows users to easily develop their own service checks
** Parallelized service checks 這跟 HA 有關嗎??
** Ability to define network host hierarchy using “parent” hosts, allowing detection of and distinction between hosts that are down and those that are unreachable 把實體連接的方式反應在組態裡，這樣 Icinga 就能判斷真的 down 還是前面有障礙暫時 unreachable 而已。
** Ability to define event handlers to be run during service or host events for proactive problem resolution
** Notification of contact persons when service or host problems occur and get resolved (via email, pager, or user-defined method) 其中 "get resolved" 有可能是因為自己好了，但也可以是 event handler 處理了。Escalation of alerts to other users or communication channels 往上呈報，條件可以怎麼設??
** Two optional user interfaces (Icinga Classic UI & Icinga Web) for visualization of host and service status, network maps, reports, logs etc. 其中 Icinga Web 並不是 Icinga 2 才有的東西，為什麼沒有用??
** Optional extension for SLA reporting that distinguishes between critical events from planned and unplanned downtimes and acknowledgement periods 這才是 business 上關注的指標!!
** Capacity utilization reporting 長期觀測下來，就能看出趨勢... 但歷史資料是放在哪裡??
