////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. 沒想到 1990 就誕生了!!
** The standard and already retired 1.8.7 implementation was written in C, as a single-pass interpreted language. Starting with the 1.9 branch, and continuing with the current 2.0 branch, YARV (Yet Another Ruby VM) has been used, and will eventually supersede the slower Ruby MRI.
** As of 2010, there are a number of complete or upcoming alternative implementations of Ruby, including YARV, JRuby, Rubinius, IronRuby, MacRuby (and its iOS counterpart, RubyMotion), mruby, HotRuby, Topaz and Opal. 真是百家爭鳴啊，遠超過 Python
** Matsumoto has said, "I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language." 由此可看出 Perl 跟 Python 各自的強項，Perl 真有那麼強？
** "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language."
** Ruby 1.8 was initially released in August 2003, was stable for a long time, and was retired June 2013. Although deprecated, there is still code based on it. Ruby 1.8 is incompatible with Ruby 1.9. 跳次版號也會不相容，反倒是 1.9 跟 2.0 是相容的 :)
** Around 2005, interest in the Ruby language surged in tandem with Ruby on Rails, a popular web application framework written in Ruby. Rails is frequently credited with making Ruby "famous". 但 Ruby 除了 web 之外，還可以做很多事!!
** Ruby 1.9 was released in December 2007. Adoption of 1.9 was slowed by changes from 1.8 which required many popular third party gems to be rewritten. 現在主流應該是 1.9 了吧??
** Ruby 2.0 is intended to be fully backward compatible with Ruby 1.9.3.
