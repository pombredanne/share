   not of the questions people actually ask, but of the questions the
   FAQ's author wishes people would ask. Perhaps you've seen the type
   before:

     Q: How can I use Glorbosoft XYZ to maximize team productivity?

     A: Many of our customers want to know how they can maximize
     productivity through our patented office groupware innovations. The
     answer is simple. First, click on the File menu, scroll down to
     Increase Productivity, thenâ¦

   The problem with such FAQs is that they are not, in a literal sense,
   FAQs at all. No one ever called the tech support line and asked, âHow
   can we maximize productivity?â Rather, people asked highly specific
   questions, such as âHow can we change the calendaring system to send
   reminders two days in advance instead of one?â and so on. But it's a
   lot easier to make up imaginary Frequently Asked Questions than it is
   to discover the real ones. Compiling a true FAQ sheet requires a
   sustained, organized effort: over the lifetime of the software,
   incoming questions must be tracked, responses monitored, and all
   gathered into a coherent, searchable whole that reflects the collective
   experience of users in the wild. It calls for the patient, observant
   attitude of a field naturalist. No grand hypothesizing, no visionary
   pronouncements hereâopen eyes and accurate note-taking are what's
   needed most.

   What I love about this book is that it grew out of just such a process,
   and shows it on every page. It is the direct result of the authors'
   encounters with users. It began with Ben Collins-Sussman's observation
   that people were asking the same basic questions over and over on the
   Subversion mailing lists: what are the standard workflows to use with
   Subversion? Do branches and tags work the same way as in other version
   control systems? How can I find out who made a particular change?

   Frustrated at seeing the same questions day after day, Ben worked
   intensely over a month in the summer of 2002 to write The Subversion
   Handbook, a 60-page manual that covered all the basics of using
   Subversion. The manual made no pretense of being complete, but it was
   distributed with Subversion and got users over that initial hump in the
   learning curve. When O'Reilly decided to publish a full-length
   Subversion book, the path of least resistance was obvious: just expand
   the Subversion handbook.

   The three coauthors of the new book were thus presented with an unusual
   opportunity. Officially, their task was to write a book top-down,
   starting from a table of contents and an initial draft. But they also
   had access to a steady streamâindeed, an uncontrollable geyserâof
   bottom-up source material. Subversion was already in the hands of
   thousands of early adopters, and those users were giving tons of
   feedback, not only about Subversion, but also about its existing
   documentation.

   During the entire time they wrote this book, Ben, Mike, and Brian
   haunted the Subversion mailing lists and chat rooms incessantly,
   carefully noting the problems users were having in real-life
   situations. Monitoring such feedback was part of their job descriptions
   at CollabNet anyway, and it gave them a huge advantage when they set
   out to document Subversion. The book they produced is grounded firmly
   in the bedrock of experience, not in the shifting sands of wishful
   thinking; it combines the best aspects of user manual and FAQ sheet.
   This duality might not be noticeable on a first reading. Taken in
   order, front to back, the book is simply a straightforward description
   of a piece of software. There's the overview, the obligatory guided
   tour, the chapter on administrative configuration, some advanced
   topics, and of course, a command reference and troubleshooting guide.
   Only when you come back to it later, seeking the solution to some
   specific problem, does its authenticity shine out: the telling details
   that can only result from encounters with the unexpected, the examples
   honed from genuine use cases, and most of all the sensitivity to the
   user's needs and the user's point of view.

   Of course, no one can promise that this book will answer every question
   you have about Subversion. Sometimes the precision with which it
   anticipates your questions will seem eerily telepathic; yet
   occasionally, you will stumble into a hole in the community's knowledge
   and come away empty-handed. When this happens, the best thing you can
   do is email <users@subversion.tigris.org> and present your problem. The
   authors are still there and still watching, and the authors include not
   just the three listed on the cover, but many others who contributed
   corrections and original material. From the community's point of view,
   solving your problem is merely a pleasant side effect of a much larger
   projectânamely, slowly adjusting this book, and ultimately Subversion
   itself, to more closely match the way people actually use it. They are
   eager to hear from you, not only because they can help you, but because
   you can help them. With Subversion, as with all active free software
   projects, you are not alone.

   Let this book be your first companion.

     âIt is important not to let the perfect become the enemy of the good,
     even when you can agree on what perfect is. Doubly so when you can't.
     As unpleasant as it is to be trapped by past mistakes, you can't make
     any progress by being afraid of your own shadow during design.â

                                         --Greg Hudson, Subversion developer

   In the world of open source software, the Concurrent Versions System
   (CVS) was the tool of choice for version control for many years. And
   rightly so. CVS was open source software itself, and its nonrestrictive
   modus operandi and support for networked operation allowed dozens of
   geographically dispersed programmers to share their work. It fit the
   collaborative nature of the open source world very well. CVS and its
   semi-chaotic development model have since become cornerstones of open
   source culture.

   But CVS was not without its flaws, and simply fixing those flaws
   promised to be an enormous effort. Enter Subversion. Subversion was
   designed to be a successor to CVS, and its originators set out to win
   the hearts of CVS users in two waysâby creating an open source system
   with a design (and âlook and feelâ) similar to CVS, and by attempting
   to avoid most of CVS's noticeable flaws. While the result isn't
   necessarily the next great evolution in version control design,
   Subversion is very powerful, very usable, and very flexible. And for
   the most part, almost all newly started open source projects now choose
   Subversion instead of CVS.

   This book is written to document the 1.5 series of the Subversion
   version control system. We have made every attempt to be thorough in
   our coverage. However, Subversion has a thriving and energetic
   development community, so already a number of features and improvements
   are planned for future versions that may change some of the commands
   and specific notes in this book.

Audience

   This book is written for computer-literate folk who want to use
   Subversion to manage their data. While Subversion runs on a number of
   different operating systems, its primary user interface is
   command-line-based. That command-line tool (svn), and some auxiliary
   programs, are the focus of this book.

   For consistency, the examples in this book assume that the reader is
   using a Unix-like operating system and is relatively comfortable with
   Unix and command-line interfaces. That said, the svn program also runs
   on non-Unix platforms such as Microsoft Windows. With a few minor
   exceptions, such as the use of backward slashes (\) instead of forward
   slashes (/) for path separators, the input to and output from this tool
   when run on Windows are identical to its Unix counterpart.

   Most readers are probably programmers or system administrators who need
   to track changes to source code. This is the most common use for
   Subversion, and therefore it is the scenario underlying all of the
   book's examples. But Subversion can be used to manage changes to any
   sort of informationâimages, music, databases, documentation, and so on.
   To Subversion, all data is just data.

   While this book is written with the assumption that the reader has
   never used a version control system, we've also tried to make it easy
   for users of CVS (and other systems) to make a painless leap into
   Subversion. Special sidebars may mention other version control systems
   from time to time, and Appendix B summarizes many of the differences
   between CVS and Subversion.

   Note also that the source code examples used throughout the book are
   only examples. While they will compile with the proper compiler
   incantations, they are intended to illustrate a particular scenario and
   not necessarily to serve as examples of good programming style or
   practices.

How to Read This Book

   Technical books always face a certain dilemma: whether to cater to
   top-down or to bottom-up learners. A top-down learner prefers to read
   or skim documentation, getting a large overview of how the system
   works; only then does she actually start using the software. A
   bottom-up learner is a âlearn by doingâ personâsomeone who just wants
   to dive into the software and figure it out as she goes, referring to
   book sections when necessary. Most books tend to be written for one
   type of person or the other, and this book is undoubtedly biased toward
   top-down learners. (And if you're actually reading this section, you're
   probably already a top-down learner yourself!) However, if you're a
   bottom-up person, don't despair. While the book may be laid out as a
   broad survey of Subversion topics, the content of each section tends to
   be heavy with specific examples that you can try-by-doing. For the
   impatient folks who just want to get going, you can jump right to
   Appendix A, Subversion Quick-Start Guide.

   Regardless of your learning style, this book aims to be useful to
   people of widely different backgroundsâfrom those with no previous
   experience in version control to experienced system administrators.
   Depending on your own background, certain chapters may be more or less
   important to you. The following can be considered a ârecommended
   reading listâ for various types of readers:

   Experienced system administrators
          The assumption here is that you've probably used version control
          before and are dying to get a Subversion server up and running
          ASAP. Chapter 5, Repository Administration and Chapter 6, Server
          Configuration will show you how to create your first repository
          and make it available over the network. After that's done,
          Chapter 2, Basic Usage and Appendix B, Subversion for CVS Users
          are the fastest routes to learning the Subversion client.

   New users
          Your administrator has probably set up Subversion already, and
          you need to learn how to use the client. If you've never used a
          version control system, then Chapter 1, Fundamental Concepts is
          a vital introduction to the ideas behind version control.
          Chapter 2, Basic Usage is a guided tour of the Subversion
          client.

   Advanced users
          Whether you're a user or administrator, eventually your project
          will grow larger. You're going to want to learn how to do more
          advanced things with Subversion, such as how to use Subversion's
          property support (Chapter 3, Advanced Topics), how to use
          branches and perform merges (Chapter 4, Branching and Merging),
          how to configure runtime options (Chapter 7, Customizing Your
          Subversion Experience), and other things. These chapters aren't
          critical at first, but be sure to read them once you're
          comfortable with the basics.

   Developers
          Presumably, you're already familiar with Subversion, and now
          want to either extend it or build new software on top of its
          many APIs. Chapter 8, Embedding Subversion is just for you.

   The book ends with reference materialâChapter 9, Subversion Complete
   Reference is a reference guide for all Subversion commands, and the
   appendixes cover a number of useful topics. These are the chapters
   you're mostly likely to come back to after you've finished the book.

Organization of This Book

   The chapters that follow and their contents are listed here:

   Chapter 1, Fundamental Concepts
          Explains the basics of version control and different versioning
          models, along with Subversion's repository, working copies, and
          revisions.

   Chapter 2, Basic Usage
          Walks you through a day in the life of a Subversion user. It
          demonstrates how to use a Subversion client to obtain, modify,
          and commit data.

   Chapter 3, Advanced Topics
          Covers more complex features that regular users will eventually
          come into contact with, such as versioned metadata, file
          locking, and peg revisions.

   Chapter 4, Branching and Merging
          Discusses branches, merges, and tagging, including best
          practices for branching and merging, common use cases, how to
          undo changes, and how to easily swing from one branch to the
          next.

   Chapter 5, Repository Administration
          Describes the basics of the Subversion repository, how to
          create, configure, and maintain a repository, and the tools you
          can use to do all of this.

   Chapter 6, Server Configuration
          Explains how to configure your Subversion server and offers
          different ways to access your repository: HTTP, the svn
          protocol, and local disk access. It also covers the details of
          authentication, authorization and anonymous access.

   Chapter 7, Customizing Your Subversion Experience
          Explores the Subversion client configuration files, the handling
          of internationalized text, and how to make external tools
          cooperate with Subversion.

   Chapter 8, Embedding Subversion
          Describes the internals of Subversion, the Subversion
          filesystem, and the working copy administrative areas from a
          programmer's point of view. It also demonstrates how to use the
          public APIs to write a program that uses Subversion.

   Chapter 9, Subversion Complete Reference
          Explains in great detail every subcommand of svn, svnadmin, and
          svnlook with plenty of examples for the whole family!

   Appendix A, Subversion Quick-Start Guide
          For the impatient, a whirlwind explanation of how to install
          Subversion and start using it immediately. You have been warned.

   Appendix B, Subversion for CVS Users
          Covers the similarities and differences between Subversion and
          CVS, with numerous suggestions on how to break all the bad
          habits you picked up from years of using CVS. Included are
          descriptions of Subversion revision numbers, versioned
          directories, offline operations, update versus status, branches,
          tags, metadata, conflict resolution, and authentication.

   Appendix C, WebDAV and Autoversioning
          Describes the details of WebDAV and DeltaV and how you can
          configure your Subversion repository to be mounted read/write as
          a DAV share.

This Book Is Free

   This book started out as bits of documentation written by Subversion
   project developers, which were then coalesced into a single work and
   rewritten. As such, it has always been under a free license (see
   Appendix D, Copyright). In fact, the book was written in the public
   eye, originally as part of the Subversion project itself. This means
   two things:
     * You will always find the latest version of this book in the book's
       own Subversion repository.
     * You can make changes to this book and redistribute it however you
       wishâit's under a free license. Your only obligation is to maintain
       proper attribution to the original authors. Of course, we'd much
       rather you send feedback and patches to the Subversion developer
       community, instead of distributing your private version of this
       book.

   The online home of this book's development and most of the
   volunteer-driven translation efforts regarding it is
   http://svnbook.red-bean.com. There you can find links to the latest
   releases and tagged versions of the book in various formats, as well as
   instructions for accessing the book's Subversion repository (where its
   DocBook XML source code lives). Feedback is welcomedâencouraged, even.
   Please submit all comments, complaints, and patches against the book

From Ben Collins-Sussman

   Thanks to my wife Frances, who, for many months, got to hear âBut
   honey, I'm still working on the book,â rather than the usual âBut
   honey, I'm still doing email.â I don't know where she gets all that
   patience! She's my perfect counterbalance.

   Thanks to my extended family and friends for their sincere
   encouragement, despite having no actual interest in the subject. (You
   know, the ones who say, âOoh, you wrote a book?â and then when you tell
   them it's a computer book, sort of glaze over.)

   Thanks to all my close friends, who make me a rich, rich man. Don't
   look at me that wayâyou know who you are.

   Thanks to my parents for the perfect low-level formatting and being
   unbelievable role models. Thanks to my kids for the opportunity to pass
   that on.

From Brian W. Fitzpatrick

   Huge thanks to my wife Marie for being incredibly understanding,
   supportive, and most of all, patient. Thank you to my brother Eric who
   first introduced me to Unix programming way back when. Thanks to my Mom
   and Grandmother for all their support, not to mention enduring a
   Christmas holiday where I came home and promptly buried my head in my
   laptop to work on the book.

   To Mike and Ben: it was a pleasure working with you on the book. Heck,
   it's a pleasure working with you at work!

   To everyone in the Subversion community and the Apache Software
   Foundation, thanks for having me. Not a day goes by where I don't learn
   something from at least one of you.

   Lastly, thanks to my grandfather, who always told me that âfreedom
   equals responsibility.â I couldn't agree more.

From C. Michael Pilato

   Special thanks to Amy, my best friend and wife of more than ten
   incredible years, for her love and patient support, for putting up with
   the late nights, and for graciously enduring the version control
   processes I've imposed on her. Don't worry, sweetheartâyou'll be a
   TortoiseSVN wizard in no time!

   Gavin, you're able to read half of the words in this book yourself now;
   sadly, it's the other half that provide the key concepts. And sorry,
   Aidan â I couldn't find a way to work Disney/Pixar characters into the
   text. But Daddy loves you both, and can't wait to teach you about
   programming.

   Mom and Dad, thanks for your constant support and enthusiasm. Mom- and
   Dad-in-law, thanks for all of the same plus your fabulous daughter.

   Hats off to Shep Kendall, through whom the world of computers was first
   opened to me; Ben Collins-Sussman, my tour guide through the open
   source world; Karl Fogel, you are my .emacs; Greg Stein, for oozing
   practical programming know-how; and Brian Fitzpatrick, for sharing this
   writing experience with me. To the many folks from whom I am constantly
   picking up new knowledgeâkeep dropping it!

   Finally, to the One who perfectly demonstrates creative
   excellenceâthank You.

What Is Subversion?

   Subversion is a free/open source version control system. That is,
   Subversion manages files and directories, and the changes made to them,
   over time. This allows you to recover older versions of your data or
   examine the history of how your data changed. In this regard, many
   people think of a version control system as a sort of âtime machine.â

   Subversion can operate across networks, which allows it to be used by
   people on different computers. At some level, the ability for various
   people to modify and manage the same set of data from their respective
   locations fosters collaboration. Progress can occur more quickly
   without a single conduit through which all modifications must occur.
   And because the work is versioned, you need not fear that quality is
   the trade-off for losing that conduitâif some incorrect change is made
   to the data, just undo that change.

   Some version control systems are also software configuration management
   (SCM) systems. These systems are specifically tailored to manage trees
   of source code and have many features that are specific to software
   developmentâsuch as natively understanding programming languages, or
   supplying tools for building software. Subversion, however, is not one
   of these systems. It is a general system that can be used to manage any
   collection of files. For you, those files might be source codeâfor
   others, anything from grocery shopping lists to digital video mixdowns
   and beyond.

Is Subversion the Right Tool?

   If you're a user or system administrator pondering the use of
   Subversion, the first question you should ask yourself is: "Is this the
   right tool for the job?" Subversion is a fantastic hammer, but be
   careful not to view every problem as a nail.

   If you need to archive old versions of files and directories, possibly
   resurrect them, or examine logs of how they've changed over time, then
   Subversion is exactly the right tool for you. If you need to
   collaborate with people on documents (usually over a network) and keep
   track of who made which changes, then Subversion is also appropriate.
   This is why Subversion is so often used in software development
   environmentsâ working on a development team is an inherently social
   activity, and Subversion makes it easy to collaborate with other
   programmers. Of course, there's a cost to using Subversion as well:
   administrative overhead. You'll need to manage a data repository to
   store the information and all its history, and be diligent about
   backing it up. When working with the data on a daily basis, you won't
   be able to copy, move, rename, or delete files the way you usually do.
   Instead, you'll have to do all of those things through Subversion.

   Assuming you're fine with the extra workflow, you should still make
   sure you're not using Subversion to solve a problem that other tools
   solve better. For example, because Subversion replicates data to all
   the collaborators involved, a common misuse is to treat it as a generic
   distribution system. People will sometimes use Subversion to distribute
   huge collections of photos, digital music, or software packages. The
   problem is that this sort of data usually isn't changing at all. The
   collection itself grows over time, but the individual files within the
   collection aren't being changed. In this case, using Subversion is
   âoverkill.â ^[2] There are simpler tools that efficiently replicate
   data without the overhead of tracking changes, such as rsync or unison.

Subversion's History

   In early 2000, CollabNet, Inc. (http://www.collab.net) began seeking
   developers to write a replacement for CVS. CollabNet offers a
   collaboration software suite called CollabNet Enterprise Edition (CEE),
   of which one component is version control. Although CEE used CVS as its
   initial version control system, CVS's limitations were obvious from the
   beginning, and CollabNet knew it would eventually have to find
   something better. Unfortunately, CVS had become the de facto standard
   in the open source world largely because there wasn't anything better,
   at least not under a free license. So CollabNet determined to write a
   new version control system from scratch, retaining the basic ideas of
   CVS, but without the bugs and misfeatures.

   In February 2000, they contacted Karl Fogel, the author of Open Source
   Development with CVS (Coriolis, 1999), and asked if he'd like to work
   on this new project. Coincidentally, at the time Karl was already
   discussing a design for a new version control system with his friend
   Jim Blandy. In 1995, the two had started Cyclic Software, a company
   providing CVS support contracts, and although they later sold the
   business, they still used CVS every day at their jobs. Their
   frustration with CVS had led Jim to think carefully about better ways
   to manage versioned data, and he'd already come up with not only the
   name âSubversion,â but also the basic design of the Subversion data
   store. When CollabNet called, Karl immediately agreed to work on the
   project, and Jim got his employer, Red Hat Software, to essentially
   donate him to the project for an indefinite period of time. CollabNet
   hired Karl and Ben Collins-Sussman, and detailed design work began in
   May 2000. With the help of some well-placed prods from Brian Behlendorf
   and Jason Robbins of CollabNet, and from Greg Stein (at the time an
   independent developer active in the WebDAV/DeltaV specification
   process), Subversion quickly attracted a community of active
   developers. It turned out that many people had encountered the same
   frustrating experiences with CVS and welcomed the chance to finally do
   something about it.

   The original design team settled on some simple goals. They didn't want
   to break new ground in version control methodology, they just wanted to
   fix CVS. They decided that Subversion would match CVS's features and
   preserve the same development model, but not duplicate CVS's most
   obvious flaws. And although it did not need to be a drop-in replacement
   for CVS, it should be similar enough that any CVS user could make the
   switch with little effort.

   After 14 months of coding, Subversion became âself-hostingâ on August
   31, 2001. That is, Subversion developers stopped using CVS to manage
   Subversion's own source code and started using Subversion instead.

   While CollabNet started the project, and still funds a large chunk of
   the work (it pays the salaries of a few full-time Subversion
   developers), Subversion is run like most open source projects, governed
   by a loose, transparent set of rules that encourage meritocracy.
   CollabNet's copyright license is fully compliant with the Debian Free
   Software Guidelines. In other words, anyone is free to download,
   modify, and redistribute Subversion as he pleases; no permission from
   CollabNet or anyone else is required.

Subversion's Architecture

   Figure 1, âSubversion's architectureâ illustrates a âmile-highâ view of
   Subversion's design.

   Figure 1. Subversion's architecture
   Subversion's architecture

   On one end is a Subversion repository that holds all of your versioned
   data. On the other end is your Subversion client program, which manages
   local reflections of portions of that versioned data (called âworking
   copiesâ). Between these extremes are multiple routes through various
   Repository Access (RA) layers. Some of these routes go across computer
   networks and through network servers which then access the repository.
   Others bypass the network altogether and access the repository
   directly.

Subversion's Components

   Subversion, once installed, has a number of different pieces. The
   following is a quick overview of what you get. Don't be alarmed if the
   brief descriptions leave you scratching your headâplenty more pages in
   this book are devoted to alleviating that confusion.

What's New in Subversion

   The first edition of this book was released in 2004, shortly after
   Subversion had reached 1.0. Over the following four years Subversion
   released five major new versions, fixing bugs and adding major new
   features. While we've managed to keep the online version of this book
   up to date, we're thrilled that the second edition from O'Reilly now
   covers Subversion up through release 1.5, a major milestone for the
   project. Here's a quick summary of major new changes since Subversion
   1.0. Note that this is not a complete list; for full details, please
   visit Subversion's web site at http://subversion.tigris.org.

   Subversion 1.1 (September 2004)
          Release 1.1 introduced FSFS, a flat-file repository storage
          option for the repository. While the Berkeley DB backend is
          still widely used and supported, FSFS has since become the
          default choice for newly created repositories due to its low
          barrier to entry and minimal maintenance requirements. Also in
          this release came the ability to put symbolic links under
          version control, auto-escaping of URLs, and a localized user
          interface.

   Subversion 1.2 (May 2005)
          Release 1.2 introduced the ability to create server-side locks
          on files, thus serializing commit access to certain resources.
          While Subversion is still a fundamentally concurrent version
          control system, certain types of binary files (e.g. art assets)
          cannot be merged together. The locking feature fulfills the need
          to version and protect such resources. With locking also came a
          complete WebDAV auto-versioning implementation, allowing
          Subversion repositories to be mounted as network folders.
          Finally, Subversion 1.2 began using a new, faster
          binary-differencing algorithm to compress and retrieve old
          versions of files.

   Subversion 1.3 (December 2005)
          Release 1.3 brought path-based authorization controls to the
          svnserve server, matching a feature formerly found only in the
          Apache server. The Apache server, however, gained some new
          logging features of its own, and Subversion's API bindings to
          other languages also made great leaps forward.

   Subversion 1.4 (September 2006)
          Release 1.4 introduced a whole new toolâsvnsyncâfor doing
          one-way repository replication over a network. Major parts of
          the working copy metadata were revamped to no longer use XML
          (resulting in client-side speed gains), while the Berkeley DB
          repository backend gained the ability to automatically recover
          itself after a server crash.

   Subversion 1.5 (June 2008)
          Release 1.5 took much longer to finish than prior releases, but
          the headliner feature was gigantic: semi-automated tracking of
          branching and merging. This was a huge boon for users, and
          pushed Subversion far beyond the abilities of CVS and into the
          ranks of commercial competitors such as Perforce and ClearCase.
          Subversion 1.5 also introduced a bevy of other user-focused
          features, such as interactive resolution of file conflicts,
          partial checkouts, client-side management of changelists,
          powerful new syntax for externals definitions, and SASL
          authentication support for the svnserve server.

   Summary

   This chapter is a short, casual introduction to Subversion. If you're
   new to version control, this chapter is definitely for you. We begin
   with a discussion of general version control concepts, work our way
   into the specific ideas behind Subversion, and show some simple
   examples of Subversion in use.

   Even though the examples in this chapter show people sharing
   collections of program source code, keep in mind that Subversion can
   manage any sort of file collectionâit's not limited to helping computer
   programmers.

The Repository

   Subversion is a centralized system for sharing information. At its core
   is a repository, which is a central store of data. The repository
   stores information in the form of a filesystem treeâa typical hierarchy
   of files and directories. Any number of clients connect to the
   repository, and then read or write to these files. By writing data, a
   client makes the information available to others; by reading data, the
   client receives information from others. Figure 1.1, âA typical
   client/server systemâ illustrates this.

   Figure 1.1. A typical client/server system
   A typical client/server system

   So why is this interesting? So far, this sounds like the definition of
   a typical file server. And indeed, the repository is a kind of file
   server, but it's not your usual breed. What makes the Subversion
   repository special is that it remembers every change ever written to
   itâevery change to every file, and even changes to the directory tree
   itself, such as the addition, deletion, and rearrangement of files and
   directories.

   When a client reads data from the repository, it normally sees only the
   latest version of the filesystem tree. But the client also has the
   ability to view previous states of the filesystem. For example, a
   client can ask historical questions such as âWhat did this directory
   contain last Wednesday?â and âWho was the last person to change this
   file, and what changes did he make?â These are the sorts of questions
   that are at the heart of any version control system: systems that are
   designed to track changes to data over time.

Versioning Models

   The core mission of a version control system is to enable collaborative
   editing and sharing of data. But different systems use different
   strategies to achieve this. It's important to understand these
   different strategies, for a couple of reasons. First, it will help you
   compare and contrast existing version control systems, in case you
   encounter other systems similar to Subversion. Beyond that, it will
   also help you make more effective use of Subversion, since Subversion
   itself supports a couple of different ways of working.

The Problem of File Sharing

   All version control systems have to solve the same fundamental problem:
   how will the system allow users to share information, but prevent them
   from accidentally stepping on each other's feet? It's all too easy for
   users to accidentally overwrite each other's changes in the repository.

   Consider the scenario shown in Figure 1.2, âThe problem to avoidâ.
   Suppose we have two coworkers, Harry and Sally. They each decide to
   edit the same repository file at the same time. If Harry saves his
   changes to the repository first, it's possible that (a few moments
   later) Sally could accidentally overwrite them with her own new version
   of the file. While Harry's version of the file won't be lost forever
   (because the system remembers every change), any changes Harry made
   won't be present in Sally's newer version of the file, because she
   never saw Harry's changes to begin with. Harry's work is still
   effectively lostâor at least missing from the latest version of the
   fileâand probably by accident. This is definitely a situation we want
   to avoid!

   Figure 1.2. The problem to avoid
   The problem to avoid

The Lock-Modify-Unlock Solution

   Many version control systems use a lock-modify-unlock model to address
   the problem of many authors clobbering each other's work. In this
   model, the repository allows only one person to change a file at a
   time. This exclusivity policy is managed using locks. Harry must âlockâ
   a file before he can begin making changes to it. If Harry has locked a
   file, Sally cannot also lock it, and therefore cannot make any changes
   to that file. All she can do is read the file and wait for Harry to
   finish his changes and release his lock. After Harry unlocks the file,
   Sally can take her turn by locking and editing the file. Figure 1.3,
   âThe lock-modify-unlock solutionâ demonstrates this simple solution.

   Figure 1.3. The lock-modify-unlock solution
   The lock-modify-unlock solution

   The problem with the lock-modify-unlock model is that it's a bit
   restrictive and often becomes a roadblock for users:
     * Locking may cause administrative problems. Sometimes Harry will
       lock a file and then forget about it. Meanwhile, because Sally is
       still waiting to edit the file, her hands are tied. And then Harry
       goes on vacation. Now Sally has to get an administrator to release
       Harry's lock. The situation ends up causing a lot of unnecessary
       delay and wasted time.
     * Locking may cause unnecessary serialization. What if Harry is
       editing the beginning of a text file, and Sally simply wants to
       edit the end of the same file? These changes don't overlap at all.
       They could easily edit the file simultaneously, and no great harm
       would come, assuming the changes were properly merged together.
       There's no need for them to take turns in this situation.
     * Locking may create a false sense of security. Suppose Harry locks
       and edits file A, while Sally simultaneously locks and edits file
       B. But what if A and B depend on one another, and the changes made
       to each are semantically incompatible? Suddenly A and B don't work
       together anymore. The locking system was powerless to prevent the
       problemâyet it somehow provided a false sense of security. It's
       easy for Harry and Sally to imagine that by locking files, each is
       beginning a safe, insulated task, and thus they need not bother
       discussing their incompatible changes early on. Locking often
       becomes a substitute for real communication.

The Copy-Modify-Merge Solution

   Subversion, CVS, and many other version control systems use a
   copy-modify-merge model as an alternative to locking. In this model,
   each user's client contacts the project repository and creates a
   personal working copyâa local reflection of the repository's files and
   directories. Users then work simultaneously and independently,
   modifying their private copies. Finally, the private copies are merged
   together into a new, final version. The version control system often
   assists with the merging, but ultimately, a human being is responsible
   for making it happen correctly.

   Here's an example. Say that Harry and Sally each create working copies
   of the same project, copied from the repository. They work concurrently
   and make changes to the same file A within their copies. Sally saves
   her changes to the repository first. When Harry attempts to save his
   changes later, the repository informs him that his file A is out of
   date. In other words, file A in the repository has somehow changed
   since he last copied it. So Harry asks his client to merge any new
   changes from the repository into his working copy of file A. Chances
   are that Sally's changes don't overlap with his own; once he has both
   sets of changes integrated, he saves his working copy back to the
   repository. Figure 1.4, âThe copy-modify-merge solutionâ and
   Figure 1.5, âThe copy-modify-merge solution (continued)â show this
   process.

   Figure 1.4. The copy-modify-merge solution
   The copy-modify-merge solution

   Figure 1.5. The copy-modify-merge solution (continued)
   The copy-modify-merge solution (continued)

   But what if Sally's changes do overlap with Harry's changes? What then?
   This situation is called a conflict, and it's usually not much of a
   problem. When Harry asks his client to merge the latest repository
   changes into his working copy, his copy of file A is somehow flagged as
   being in a state of conflict: he'll be able to see both sets of
   conflicting changes and manually choose between them. Note that
   software can't automatically resolve conflicts; only humans are capable
   of understanding and making the necessary intelligent choices. Once
   Harry has manually resolved the overlapping changesâperhaps after a
   discussion with Sallyâhe can safely save the merged file back to the
   repository.

   The copy-modify-merge model may sound a bit chaotic, but in practice,
   it runs extremely smoothly. Users can work in parallel, never waiting
   for one another. When they work on the same files, it turns out that
   most of their concurrent changes don't overlap at all; conflicts are
   infrequent. And the amount of time it takes to resolve conflicts is
   usually far less than the time lost by a locking system.

   In the end, it all comes down to one critical factor: user
   communication. When users communicate poorly, both syntactic and
   semantic conflicts increase. No system can force users to communicate
   perfectly, and no system can detect semantic conflicts. So there's no
   point in being lulled into a false sense of security that a locking
   system will somehow prevent conflicts; in practice, locking seems to
   inhibit productivity more than anything else.

   When Locking Is Necessary

   While the lock-modify-unlock model is considered generally harmful to
   collaboration, sometimes locking is appropriate.

   The copy-modify-merge model is based on the assumption that files are
   contextually mergeableâthat is, that the majority of the files in the
   repository are line-based text files (such as program source code). But
   for files with binary formats, such as artwork or sound, it's often
   impossible to merge conflicting changes. In these situations, it really
   is necessary for users to take strict turns when changing the file.
   Without serialized access, somebody ends up wasting time on changes
   that are ultimately discarded.

   While Subversion is primarily a copy-modify-merge system, it still
   recognizes the need to lock an occasional file, and thus provides
   mechanisms for this. We discuss this feature in the section called
   âLockingâ.

Subversion in Action

   It's time to move from the abstract to the concrete. In this section,
   we'll show real examples of Subversion being used.

Subversion Repository URLs

   Throughout this book, Subversion uses URLs to identify versioned files
   and directories in Subversion repositories. For the most part, these
   URLs use the standard syntax, allowing for server names and port
   numbers to be specified as part of the URL:
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com:9834/repos
â¦

   But there are some nuances in Subversion's handling of URLs that are
   notable. For example, URLs containing the file:// access method (used
   for local repositories) must, in accordance with convention, have
   either a server name of localhost or no server name at all:
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos
â¦
$ svn checkout file://localhost/var/svn/repos
â¦

   Also, users of the file:// scheme on Windows platforms will need to use
   an unofficially âstandardâ syntax for accessing repositories that are
   on the same machine, but on a different drive than the client's current
   working drive. Either of the two following URL path syntaxes will work,
   where X is the drive on which the repository resides:
C:\> svn checkout file:///X:/var/svn/repos
â¦
C:\> svn checkout "file:///X|/var/svn/repos"
â¦

   In the second syntax, you need to quote the URL so that the vertical
   bar character is not interpreted as a pipe. Also, note that a URL uses
   forward slashes even though the native (non-URL) form of a path on
   Windows uses backslashes.

Note

   You cannot use Subversion's file:// URLs in a regular web browser the
   way typical file:// URLs can. When you attempt to view a file:// URL in
   a regular web browser, it reads and displays the contents of the file
   at that location by examining the filesystem directly. However,
   Subversion's resources exist in a virtual filesystem (see the section
   called âRepository Layerâ), and your browser will not understand how to
   interact with that filesystem.

   Finally, it should be noted that the Subversion client will
   automatically encode URLs as necessary, just like a web browser does.
   For example, if a URL contains a space or upper-ASCII character as in
   the following:
$ svn checkout "http://host/path with space/project/espaÃ±a"

   then Subversion will escape the unsafe characters and behave as though
   you had typed:
$ svn checkout http://host/path%20with%20space/project/espa%C3%B1a

   If the URL contains spaces, be sure to place it within quotation marks
   so that your shell treats the whole thing as a single argument to the
   svn program.

   Repository URLs

   You can access Subversion repositories through many different
   methodsâon local disk or through various network protocols, depending
   on how your administrator has set things up for you. A repository
   location, however, is always a URL. Table 1.1, âRepository access URLsâ
   describes how different URL schemes map to the available access
   methods.

   Table 1.1. Repository access URLs
     Schema                          Access method
   file:///   Direct repository access (on local disk)
   http://    Access via WebDAV protocol to Subversion-aware Apache server
   https://   Same as http://, but with SSL encryption.
   svn://     Access via custom protocol to an svnserve server
   svn+ssh:// Same as svn://, but through an SSH tunnel.

   For more information on how Subversion parses URLs, see the section
   called âSubversion Repository URLsâ. For more information on the
   different types of network servers available for Subversion, see
   Chapter 6, Server Configuration.

Working Copies

   You've already read about working copies; now we'll demonstrate how the
   Subversion client creates and uses them.

   A Subversion working copy is an ordinary directory tree on your local
   system, containing a collection of files. You can edit these files
   however you wish, and if they're source code files, you can compile
   your program from them in the usual way. Your working copy is your own
   private work area: Subversion will never incorporate other people's
   changes, nor make your own changes available to others, until you
   explicitly tell it to do so. You can even have multiple working copies
   of the same project.

   After you've made some changes to the files in your working copy and
   verified that they work properly, Subversion provides you with commands
   to âpublishâ your changes to the other people working with you on your
   project (by writing to the repository). If other people publish their
   own changes, Subversion provides you with commands to merge those
   changes into your working copy (by reading from the repository).

   A working copy also contains some extra files, created and maintained
   by Subversion, to help it carry out these commands. In particular, each
   directory in your working copy contains a subdirectory named .svn, also
   known as the working copy's administrative directory. The files in each
   administrative directory help Subversion recognize which files contain
   unpublished changes, and which files are out of date with respect to
   others' work.

   A typical Subversion repository often holds the files (or source code)
   for several projects; usually, each project is a subdirectory in the
   repository's filesystem tree. In this arrangement, a user's working
   copy will usually correspond to a particular subtree of the repository.

   For example, suppose you have a repository that contains two software
   projects, paint and calc. Each project lives in its own top-level
   subdirectory, as shown in Figure 1.6, âThe repository's filesystemâ.

   Figure 1.6. The repository's filesystem
   The repository's filesystem

   To get a working copy, you must check out some subtree of the
   repository. (The term check out may sound like it has something to do
   with locking or reserving resources, but it doesn't; it simply creates
   a private copy of the project for you.) For example, if you check out
   /calc, you will get a working copy like this:
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/calc
A    calc/Makefile
A    calc/integer.c
A    calc/button.c
Checked out revision 56.

$ ls -A calc
Makefile  button.c integer.c .svn/

   The list of letter As in the left margin indicates that Subversion is
   adding a number of items to your working copy. You now have a personal
   copy of the repository's /calc directory, with one additional
   entryâ.svnâwhich holds the extra information needed by Subversion, as
   mentioned earlier.

   Suppose you make changes to button.c. Since the .svn directory
   remembers the file's original modification date and contents,
   Subversion can tell that you've changed the file. However, Subversion
   does not make your changes public until you explicitly tell it to. The
   act of publishing your changes is more commonly known as committing (or
   checking in) changes to the repository.

   To publish your changes to others, you can use Subversion's svn commit
   command:
$ svn commit button.c -m "Fixed a typo in button.c."
Sending        button.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 57.

   Now your changes to button.c have been committed to the repository,
   with a note describing your change (namely, that you fixed a typo). If
   another user checks out a working copy of /calc, she will see your
   changes in the latest version of the file.

   Suppose you have a collaborator, Sally, who checked out a working copy
   of /calc at the same time you did. When you commit your change to
   button.c, Sally's working copy is left unchanged; Subversion modifies
   working copies only at the user's request.

   To bring her project up to date, Sally can ask Subversion to update her
   working copy, by using the svn update command. This will incorporate
   your changes into her working copy, as well as any others that have
   been committed since she checked it out.
$ pwd
/home/sally/calc

$ ls -A
Makefile button.c integer.c .svn/

$ svn update
U    button.c
Updated to revision 57.

   The output from the svn update command indicates that Subversion
   updated the contents of button.c. Note that Sally didn't need to
   specify which files to update; Subversion uses the information in the
   .svn directory as well as further information in the repository, to
   decide which files need to be brought up to date.

Revisions

   An svn commit operation publishes changes to any number of files and
   directories as a single atomic transaction. In your working copy, you
   can change files' contents; create, delete, rename, and copy files and
   directories; and then commit a complete set of changes as an atomic
   transaction.

   By atomic transaction, we mean simply this: either all of the changes
   happen in the repository, or none of them happens. Subversion tries to
   retain this atomicity in the face of program crashes, system crashes,
   network problems, and other users' actions.

   Each time the repository accepts a commit, this creates a new state of
   the filesystem tree, called a revision. Each revision is assigned a
   unique natural number, one greater than the number of the previous
   revision. The initial revision of a freshly created repository is
   numbered 0 and consists of nothing but an empty root directory.

   Figure 1.7, âThe repositoryâ illustrates a nice way to visualize the
   repository. Imagine an array of revision numbers, starting at 0,
   stretching from left to right. Each revision number has a filesystem
   tree hanging below it, and each tree is a âsnapshotâ of the way the
   repository looked after a commit.

   Figure 1.7. The repository
   The repository

   Global Revision Numbers

   Unlike most version control systems, Subversion's revision numbers
   apply to entire trees, not individual files. Each revision number
   selects an entire tree, a particular state of the repository after some
   committed change. Another way to think about it is that revision N
   represents the state of the repository filesystem after the Nth commit.
   When Subversion users talk about ârevision 5 of foo.c,â they really
   mean âfoo.c as it appears in revision 5.â Notice that in general,
   revisions N and M of a file do not necessarily differ! Many other
   version control systems use per-file revision numbers, so this concept
   may seem unusual at first. (Former CVS users might want to see
   Appendix B, Subversion for CVS Users for more details.)

   It's important to note that working copies do not always correspond to
   any single revision in the repository; they may contain files from
   several different revisions. For example, suppose you check out a
   working copy from a repository whose most recent revision is 4:
calc/Makefile:4
     integer.c:4
     button.c:4

   At the moment, this working directory corresponds exactly to revision 4
   in the repository. However, suppose you make a change to button.c, and
   commit that change. Assuming no other commits have taken place, your
   commit will create revision 5 of the repository, and your working copy
   will now look like this:
calc/Makefile:4
     integer.c:4
     button.c:5

   Suppose that, at this point, Sally commits a change to integer.c,
   creating revision 6. If you use svn update to bring your working copy
   up to date, it will look like this:
calc/Makefile:6
     integer.c:6
     button.c:6

   Sally's change to integer.c will appear in your working copy, and your
   change will still be present in button.c. In this example, the text of
   Makefile is identical in revisions 4, 5, and 6, but Subversion will
   mark your working copy of Makefile with revision 6 to indicate that it
   is still current. So, after you do a clean update at the top of your
   working copy, it will generally correspond to exactly one revision in
   the repository.

How Working Copies Track the Repository

   For each file in a working directory, Subversion records two essential
   pieces of information in the .svn/ administrative area:
     * What revision your working file is based on (this is called the
       file's working revision)
     * A timestamp recording when the local copy was last updated by the
       repository

   Given this information, by talking to the repository, Subversion can
   tell which of the following four states a working file is in:

   Unchanged, and current
          The file is unchanged in the working directory, and no changes
          to that file have been committed to the repository since its
          working revision. An svn commit of the file will do nothing, and
          an svn update of the file will do nothing.

   Locally changed, and current
          The file has been changed in the working directory, and no
          changes to that file have been committed to the repository since
          you last updated. There are local changes that have not been
          committed to the repository; thus an svn commit of the file will
          succeed in publishing your changes, and an svn update of the
          file will do nothing.

   Unchanged, and out of date
          The file has not been changed in the working directory, but it
          has been changed in the repository. The file should eventually
          be updated in order to make it current with the latest public
          revision. An svn commit of the file will do nothing, and an svn
          update of the file will fold the latest changes into your
          working copy.

   Locally changed, and out of date
          The file has been changed both in the working directory and in
          the repository. An svn commit of the file will fail with an
          âout-of-dateâ error. The file should be updated first; an svn
          update command will attempt to merge the public changes with the
          local changes. If Subversion can't complete the merge in a
          plausible way automatically, it leaves it to the user to resolve
          the conflict.

   This may sound like a lot to keep track of, but the svn status command
   will show you the state of any item in your working copy. For more
   information on that command, see the section called âSee an overview of
   your changesâ.

Mixed Revision Working Copies

   As a general principle, Subversion tries to be as flexible as possible.
   One special kind of flexibility is the ability to have a working copy
   containing files and directories with a mix of different working
   revision numbers. Unfortunately, this flexibility tends to confuse a
   number of new users. If the earlier example showing mixed revisions
   perplexed you, here's a primer on why the feature exists and how to
   make use of it.

Updates and commits are separate

   One of the fundamental rules of Subversion is that a âpushâ action does
   not cause a âpull,â nor vice versa. Just because you're ready to submit
   new changes to the repository doesn't mean you're ready to receive
   changes from other people. And if you have new changes still in
   progress, svn update should gracefully merge repository changes into
   your own, rather than forcing you to publish them.

   The main side effect of this rule is that it means a working copy has
   to do extra bookkeeping to track mixed revisions as well as be tolerant
   of the mixture. It's made more complicated by the fact that directories
   themselves are versioned.

   For example, suppose you have a working copy entirely at revision 10.
   You edit the file foo.html and then perform an svn commit, which
   creates revision 15 in the repository. After the commit succeeds, many
   new users would expect the working copy to be entirely at revision 15,
   but that's not the case! Any number of changes might have happened in
   the repository between revisions 10 and 15. The client knows nothing of
   those changes in the repository, since you haven't yet run svn update,
   and svn commit doesn't pull down new changes. If, on the other hand,
   svn commit were to automatically download the newest changes, it would
   be possible to set the entire working copy to revision 15âbut then we'd
   be breaking the fundamental rule of âpushâ and âpullâ remaining
   separate actions. Therefore, the only safe thing the Subversion client
   can do is mark the one fileâfoo.htmlâas being at revision 15. The rest
   of the working copy remains at revision 10. Only by running svn update
   can the latest changes be downloaded and the whole working copy be
   marked as revision 15.

Mixed revisions are normal

   The fact is, every time you run svn commit your working copy ends up
   with some mixture of revisions. The things you just committed are
   marked as having larger working revisions than everything else. After
   several commits (with no updates in between), your working copy will
   contain a whole mixture of revisions. Even if you're the only person
   using the repository, you will still see this phenomenon. To examine
   your mixture of working revisions, use the svn status command with the
   --verbose option (see the section called âSee an overview of your
   changesâ for more information).

   Often, new users are completely unaware that their working copy
   contains mixed revisions. This can be confusing, because many client
   commands are sensitive to the working revision of the item they're
   examining. For example, the svn log command is used to display the
   history of changes to a file or directory (see the section called
   âGenerating a List of Historical Changesâ). When the user invokes this
   command on a working copy object, he expects to see the entire history
   of the object. But if the object's working revision is quite old (often
   because svn update hasn't been run in a long time), the history of the
   older version of the object is shown.

Mixed revisions are useful

   If your project is sufficiently complex, you'll discover that it's
   sometimes nice to forcibly backdate (or update to a revision older than
   the one you already have) portions of your working copy to an earlier
   revision; you'll learn how to do that in Chapter 2, Basic Usage.
   Perhaps you'd like to test an earlier version of a submodule contained
   in a subdirectory, or perhaps you'd like to figure out when a bug first
   came into existence in a specific file. This is the âtime machineâ
   aspect of a version control systemâthe feature that allows you to move
   any portion of your working copy forward and backward in history.

Mixed revisions have limitations

   However you make use of mixed revisions in your working copy, there are
   limitations to this flexibility.

   First, you cannot commit the deletion of a file or directory that isn't
   fully up to date. If a newer version of the item exists in the
   repository, your attempt to delete will be rejected to prevent you from
   accidentally destroying changes you've not yet seen.

   Second, you cannot commit a metadata change to a directory unless it's
   fully up to date. You'll learn about attaching âpropertiesâ to items in
   Chapter 3, Advanced Topics. A directory's working revision defines a
   specific set of entries and properties, and thus committing a property
   change to an out-of-date directory may destroy properties you've not
   yet seen.

Summary

   We covered a number of fundamental Subversion concepts in this chapter:
     * We introduced the notions of the central repository, the client
       working copy, and the array of repository revision trees.
     * We saw some simple examples of how two collaborators can use
       Subversion to publish and receive changes from one another, using
       the âcopy-modify-mergeâ model.
     * We talked a bit about the way Subversion tracks and manages
       information in a working copy.

   At this point, you should have a good idea of how Subversion works in
   the most general sense. Armed with this knowledge, you should now be
   ready to move into the next chapter, which is a detailed tour of
   Subversion's commands and features.

   Summary

   Now we will go into the details of using Subversion. By the time you
   reach the end of this chapter, you will be able to perform all the
   tasks you need to use Subversion in a normal day's work. You'll start
   with getting your files into Subversion, followed by an initial
   checkout of your code. We'll then walk you through making changes and
   examining those changes. You'll also see how to bring changes made by
   others into your working copy, examine them, and work through any
   conflicts that might arise.

   Note that this chapter is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all of
   Subversion's commandsârather, it's a conversational introduction to the
   most common Subversion tasks that you'll encounter. This chapter
   assumes that you've read and understood Chapter 1, Fundamental Concepts
   and are familiar with the general model of Subversion. For a complete
   reference of all commands, see Chapter 9, Subversion Complete
   Reference.

Help!

   Before reading on, here is the most important command you'll ever need
   when using Subversion: svn help. The Subversion command-line client is
   self-documentingâat any time, a quick svn help subcommand will describe
   the syntax, options, and behavior of the subcommand.
$ svn help import
import: Commit an unversioned file or tree into the repository.
usage: import [PATH] URL

  Recursively commit a copy of PATH to URL.
  If PATH is omitted '.' is assumed.
  Parent directories are created as necessary in the repository.
  If PATH is a directory, the contents of the directory are added
  directly under URL.
  Unversionable items such as device files and pipes are ignored
  if --force is specified.

Valid options:
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  -N [--non-recursive]     : obsolete; try --depth=files or --depth=immediates
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',
                             'immediates', or 'infinity')
â¦

   Options and Switches and Flags, Oh My!

   The Subversion command-line client has numerous command modifiers
   (which we call options), but there are two distinct kinds of options:
   short options are a single hyphen followed by a single letter, and long
   options consist of two hyphens followed by a number of letters (e.g.,
   -s and --this-is-a-long-option, respectively). Every option has a long
   format, but only certain options have an additional short format (these
   are typically options that are frequently used). To maintain clarity,
   we usually use the long form in code examples, but when describing
   options, if there's a short form, we'll provide the long form (to
   improve clarity) and the short form (to make it easier to remember).
   You should use whichever one you're more comfortable with, but don't
   try to use both.

Getting Data into Your Repository

   You can get new files into your Subversion repository in two ways: svn
   import and svn add. We'll discuss svn import now and will discuss svn
   add later in this chapter when we review a typical day with Subversion.

svn import

   The svn import command is a quick way to copy an unversioned tree of
   files into a repository, creating intermediate directories as
   necessary. svn import doesn't require a working copy, and your files
   are immediately committed to the repository. You typically use this
   when you have an existing tree of files that you want to begin tracking
   in your Subversion repository. For example:
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/newrepos
$ svn import mytree file:///var/svn/newrepos/some/project \
             -m "Initial import"
Adding         mytree/foo.c
Adding         mytree/bar.c
Adding         mytree/subdir
Adding         mytree/subdir/quux.h

Committed revision 1.

   The previous example copied the contents of directory mytree under the
   directory some/project in the repository:
$ svn list file:///var/svn/newrepos/some/project
bar.c
foo.c
subdir/

   Note that after the import is finished, the original tree is not
   converted into a working copy. To start working, you still need to svn
   checkout a fresh working copy of the tree.

Recommended Repository Layout

   While Subversion's flexibility allows you to lay out your repository in
   any way that you choose, we recommend that you create a trunk directory
   to hold the âmain lineâ of development, a branches directory to contain
   branch copies, and a tags directory to contain tag copies. For example:
$ svn list file:///var/svn/repos
/trunk
/branches
/tags

   You'll learn more about tags and branches in Chapter 4, Branching and
   Merging. For details and how to set up multiple projects, see the
   section called âRepository Layoutâ and the section called âPlanning
   Your Repository Organizationâ to read more about project roots.

Initial Checkout

   Most of the time, you will start using a Subversion repository by doing
   a checkout of your project. Checking out a repository creates a
   âworking copyâ of it on your local machine. This copy contains the HEAD
   (latest revision) of the Subversion repository that you specify on the
   command line:
$ svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk
A    trunk/Makefile.in
A    trunk/ac-helpers
A    trunk/ac-helpers/install.sh
A    trunk/ac-helpers/install-sh
A    trunk/build.conf
â¦
Checked out revision 8810.

   What's in a Name?

   Subversion tries hard not to limit the type of data you can place under
   version control. The contents of files and property values are stored
   and transmitted as binary data, and the section called âFile Content
   Typeâ tells you how to give Subversion a hint that âtextualâ operations
   don't make sense for a particular file. There are a few places,
   however, where Subversion places restrictions on information it stores.

   Subversion internally handles certain bits of dataâfor example,
   property names, pathnames, and log messagesâas UTF-8-encoded Unicode.
   This is not to say that all your interactions with Subversion must
   involve UTF-8, though. As a general rule, Subversion clients will
   gracefully and transparently handle conversions between UTF-8 and the
   encoding system in use on your computer, if such a conversion can
   meaningfully be done (which is the case for most common encodings in
   use today).

   In WebDAV exchanges and older versions of some of Subversion's
   administrative files, paths are used as XML attribute values, and
   property names in XML tag names. This means that pathnames can contain
   only legal XML (1.0) characters, and properties are further limited to
   ASCII characters. Subversion also prohibits TAB, CR, and LF characters
   in path names to prevent paths from being broken up in diffs or in the
   output of commands such as svn log or svn status.

   While it may seem like a lot to remember, in practice these limitations
   are rarely a problem. As long as your locale settings are compatible
   with UTF-8 and you don't use control characters in path names, you
   should have no trouble communicating with Subversion. The command-line
   client adds an extra bit of helpâto create âlegally correctâ versions
   for internal use it will automatically escape illegal path characters
   as needed in URLs that you type.

   Although the preceding example checks out the trunk directory, you can
   just as easily check out any deep subdirectory of a repository by
   specifying the subdirectory in the checkout URL:
$ svn checkout \
      http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/tests/cmdline/
A    cmdline/revert_tests.py
A    cmdline/diff_tests.py
A    cmdline/autoprop_tests.py
A    cmdline/xmltests
A    cmdline/xmltests/svn-test.sh
â¦
Checked out revision 8810.

   Since Subversion uses a copy-modify-merge model instead of
   lock-modify-unlock (see the section called âVersioning Modelsâ), you
   can immediately make changes to the files and directories in your
   working copy. Your working copy is just like any other collection of
   files and directories on your system. You can edit and change it, move
   it around, even delete the entire working copy and forget about it.

Warning

   While your working copy is âjust like any other collection of files and
   directories on your system,â you can edit files at will, but you must
   tell Subversion about everything else that you do. For example, if you
   want to copy or move an item in a working copy, you should use svn copy
   or svn move instead of the copy and move commands provided by your
   operating system. We'll talk more about them later in this chapter.

   Unless you're ready to commit the addition of a new file or directory
   or changes to existing ones, there's no need to further notify the
   Subversion server that you've done anything.

   What's with the .svn Directory?

   Every directory in a working copy contains an administrative areaâa
   subdirectory named .svn. Usually, directory listing commands won't show
   this subdirectory, but it is nevertheless an important directory.
   Whatever you do, don't delete or change anything in the administrative
   area! Subversion depends on it to manage your working copy.

   If you accidentally remove the .svn subdirectory, the easiest way to
   fix the problem is to remove the entire containing directory (a normal
   system deletion, not svn delete), then run svn update from a parent
   directory. The Subversion client will download the directory you've
   deleted, with a new .svn area as well.

   While you can certainly check out a working copy with the URL of the
   repository as the only argument, you can also specify a directory after
   your repository URL. This places your working copy in the new directory
   that you name. For example:
$  svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk subv
A    subv/Makefile.in
A    subv/ac-helpers
A    subv/ac-helpers/install.sh
A    subv/ac-helpers/install-sh
A    subv/build.conf
â¦
Checked out revision 8810.

   That will place your working copy in a directory named subv instead of
   a directory named trunk as we did previously. The directory subv will
   be created if it doesn't already exist.

Disabling Password Caching

   When you perform a Subversion operation that requires you to
   authenticate, by default Subversion caches your authentication
   credentials on disk. This is done for convenience so that you don't
   have to continually reenter your password for future operations. If
   you're concerned about caching your Subversion passwords, ^[3] you can
   disable caching either permanently or on a case-by-case basis.

   To disable password caching for a particular one-time command, pass the
   --no-auth-cache option on the command line. To permanently disable
   caching, you can add the line store-passwords = no to your local
   machine's Subversion configuration file. See the section called âClient
   Credentials Cachingâ for details.

Authenticating As a Different User

   Since Subversion caches auth credentials by default (both username and
   password), it conveniently remembers who you were acting as the last
   time you modified your working copy. But sometimes that's not
   helpfulâparticularly if you're working in a shared working copy such as
   a system configuration directory or a web server document root. In this
   case, just pass the --username option on the command line, and
   Subversion will attempt to authenticate as that user, prompting you for
   a password if necessary.

Basic Work Cycle

   Subversion has numerous features, options, bells, and whistles, but on
   a day-to-day basis, odds are that you will use only a few of them. In
   this section, we'll run through the most common things that you might
   find yourself doing with Subversion in the course of a day's work.

   The typical work cycle looks like this:
    1. Update your working copy.
          + svn update
    2. Make changes.
          + svn add
          + svn delete
          + svn copy
          + svn move
    3. Examine your changes.
          + svn status
          + svn diff
    4. Possibly undo some changes.
          + svn revert
    5. Resolve conflicts (merge others' changes).
          + svn update
          + svn resolve
    6. Commit your changes.
          + svn commit

Update Your Working Copy

   When working on a project with a team, you'll want to update your
   working copy to receive any changes other developers on the project
   have made since your last update. Use svn update to bring your working
   copy into sync with the latest revision in the repository:
$ svn update
U  foo.c
U  bar.c
Updated to revision 2.

   In this case, it appears that someone checked in modifications to both
   foo.c and bar.c since the last time you updated, and Subversion has
   updated your working copy to include those changes.

   When the server sends changes to your working copy via svn update, a
   letter code is displayed next to each item to let you know what actions
   Subversion performed to bring your working copy up to date. To find out
   what these letters mean, run svn help update.

Make Changes to Your Working Copy

   Now you can get to work and make changes in your working copy. It's
   usually most convenient to decide on a discrete change (or set of
   changes) to make, such as writing a new feature, fixing a bug, and so
   on. The Subversion commands that you will use here are svn add, svn
   delete, svn copy, svn move, and svn mkdir. However, if you are merely
   editing files that are already in Subversion, you may not need to use
   any of these commands until you commit.

   You can make two kinds of changes to your working copy: file changes
   and tree changes. You don't need to tell Subversion that you intend to
   change a file; just make your changes using your text editor, word
   processor, graphics program, or whatever tool you would normally use.
   Subversion automatically detects which files have been changed, and in
   addition, it handles binary files just as easily as it handles text
   filesâand just as efficiently, too. For tree changes, you can ask
   Subversion to âmarkâ files and directories for scheduled removal,
   addition, copying, or moving. These changes may take place immediately
   in your working copy, but no additions or removals will happen in the
   repository until you commit them.

   Versioning Symbolic Links

   On non-Windows platforms, Subversion is able to version files of the
   special type symbolic link (or âsymlinkâ). A symlink is a file that
   acts as a sort of transparent reference to some other object in the
   filesystem, allowing programs to read and write to those objects
   indirectly by way of performing operations on the symlink itself.

   When a symlink is committed into a Subversion repository, Subversion
   remembers that the file was in fact a symlink, as well as the object to
   which the symlink âpoints.â When that symlink is checked out to another
   working copy on a non-Windows system, Subversion reconstructs a real
   filesystem-level symbolic link from the versioned symlink. But that
   doesn't in any way limit the usability of working copies on systems
   such as Windows that do not support symlinks. On such systems,
   Subversion simply creates a regular text file whose contents are the
   path to which to the original symlink pointed. While that file can't be
   used as a symlink on a Windows system, it also won't prevent Windows
   users from performing their other Subversion-related activities.

   Here is an overview of the five Subversion subcommands that you'll use
   most often to make tree changes:

   svn add foo
          Schedule file, directory, or symbolic link foo to be added to
          the repository. When you next commit, foo will become a child of
          its parent directory. Note that if foo is a directory,
          everything underneath foo will be scheduled for addition. If you
          want only to add foo itself, pass the --depth empty option.

   svn delete foo
          Schedule file, directory, or symbolic link foo to be deleted
          from the repository. If foo is a file or link, it is immediately
          deleted from your working copy. If foo is a directory, it is not
          deleted, but Subversion schedules it for deletion. When you
          commit your changes, foo will be entirely removed from your
          working copy and the repository. ^[4]

   svn copy foo bar
          Create a new item bar as a duplicate of foo and automatically
          schedule bar for addition. When bar is added to the repository
          on the next commit, its copy history is recorded (as having
          originally come from foo). svn copy does not create intermediate
          directories unless you pass the --parents option.

   svn move foo bar
          This command is exactly the same as running svn copy foo bar;
          svn delete foo. That is, bar is scheduled for addition as a copy
          of foo, and foo is scheduled for removal. svn move does not
          create intermediate directories unless you pass the --parents
          option.

   svn mkdir blort
          This command is exactly the same as running mkdir blort; svn add
          blort. That is, a new directory named blort is created and
          scheduled for addition.

   Changing the Repository Without a Working Copy

   There are some use cases that immediately commit tree changes to the
   repository. This happens only when a subcommand is operating directly
   on a URL, rather than on a working-copy path. In particular, specific
   uses of svn mkdir, svn copy, svn move, and svn delete can work with
   URLs (and don't forget that svn import always makes changes to a URL).

   URL operations behave in this manner because commands that operate on a
   working copy can use the working copy as a sort of âstaging areaâ to
   set up your changes before committing them to the repository. Commands
   that operate on URLs don't have this luxury, so when you operate
   directly on a URL, any of the aforementioned actions represents an
   immediate commit.

Examine Your Changes

   Once you've finished making changes, you need to commit them to the
   repository, but before you do so, it's usually a good idea to take a
   look at exactly what you've changed. By examining your changes before
   you commit, you can make a more accurate log message. You may also
   discover that you've inadvertently changed a file, and this gives you a
   chance to revert those changes before committing. Additionally, this is
   a good opportunity to review and scrutinize changes before publishing
   them. You can see an overview of the changes you've made by using svn
   status, and dig into the details of those changes by using svn diff.

   Look Ma! No Network!

   You can use the commands svn status, svn diff, and svn revert without
   any network access even if your repository is across the network. This
   makes it easy to manage your changes-in-progress when you are somewhere
   without a network connection, such as traveling on an airplane, riding
   a commuter train, or hacking on the beach. ^[5]

   Subversion does this by keeping private caches of pristine versions of
   each versioned file inside the .svn administrative areas. This allows
   Subversion to reportâand revertâlocal modifications to those files
   without network access. This cache (called the âtext-baseâ) also allows
   Subversion to send the user's local modifications during a commit to
   the server as a compressed delta (or âdifferenceâ) against the pristine
   version. Having this cache is a tremendous benefitâeven if you have a
   fast Internet connection, it's much faster to send only a file's
   changes rather than the whole file to the server.

   Subversion has been optimized to help you with this task, and it is
   able to do many things without communicating with the repository. In
   particular, your working copy contains a hidden cached âpristineâ copy
   of each version-controlled file within the .svn area. Because of this,
   Subversion can quickly show you how your working files have changed or
   even allow you to undo your changes without contacting the repository.

See an overview of your changes

   To get an overview of your changes, you'll use the svn status command.
   You'll probably use svn status more than any other Subversion command.

   CVS Users: Hold That Update!

   You're probably used to using cvs update to see what changes you've
   made to your working copy. svn status will give you all the information
   you need regarding what has changed in your working copyâwithout
   accessing the repository or potentially incorporating new changes
   published by other users.

   In Subversion, svn update does just thatâit updates your working copy
   with any changes committed to the repository since the last time you
   updated your working copy. You may have to break the habit of using the
   update command to see what local modifications you've made.

   If you run svn status at the top of your working copy with no
   arguments, it will detect all file and tree changes you've made. Here
   are a few examples of the most common status codes that svn status can
   return. (Note that the text following # is not actually printed by svn
   status.)
?       scratch.c           # file is not under version control
A       stuff/loot/bloo.h   # file is scheduled for addition
C       stuff/loot/lump.c   # file has textual conflicts from an update
D       stuff/fish.c        # file is scheduled for deletion
M       bar.c               # the content in bar.c has local modifications

   In this output format, svn status prints six columns of characters,
   followed by several whitespace characters, followed by a file or
   directory name. The first column tells the status of a file or
   directory and/or its contents. The codes we listed are:

   A item
          The file, directory, or symbolic link item has been scheduled
          for addition into the repository.

   C item
          The file item is in a state of conflict. That is, changes
          received from the server during an update overlap with local
          changes that you have in your working copy (and weren't resolved
          during the update). You must resolve this conflict before
          committing your changes to the repository.

   D item
          The file, directory, or symbolic link item has been scheduled
          for deletion from the repository.

   M item
          The contents of the file item have been modified.

   If you pass a specific path to svn status, you get information about
   that item alone:
$ svn status stuff/fish.c
D      stuff/fish.c

   svn status also has a --verbose (-v) option, which will show you the
   status of every item in your working copy, even if it has not been
   changed:
$ svn status -v
M               44        23    sally     README
                44        30    sally     INSTALL
M               44        20    harry     bar.c
                44        18    ira       stuff
                44        35    harry     stuff/trout.c
D               44        19    ira       stuff/fish.c
                44        21    sally     stuff/things
A                0         ?     ?        stuff/things/bloo.h
                44        36    harry     stuff/things/gloo.c

   This is the âlong formâ output of svn status. The letters in the first
   column mean the same as before, but the second column shows the working
   revision of the item. The third and fourth columns show the revision in
   which the item last changed, and who changed it.

   None of the prior invocations to svn status contact the
   repositoryâinstead, they compare the metadata in the .svn directory
   with the working copy. Finally, there is the --show-updates (-u)
   option, which contacts the repository and adds information about things
   that are out of date:
$ svn status -u -v
M      *        44        23    sally     README
M               44        20    harry     bar.c
       *        44        35    harry     stuff/trout.c
D               44        19    ira       stuff/fish.c
A                0         ?     ?        stuff/things/bloo.h
Status against revision:   46

   Notice the two asterisks: if you were to run svn update at this point,
   you would receive changes to README and trout.c. This tells you some
   very useful informationâyou'll need to update and get the server
   changes on README before you commit, or the repository will reject your
   commit for being out of date (more on this subject later).

   svn status can display much more information about the files and
   directories in your working copy than we've shown hereâfor an
   exhaustive description of svn status and its output, see svn status.

Examine the details of your local modifications

   Another way to examine your changes is with the svn diff command. You
   can find out exactly how you've modified things by running svn diff
   with no arguments, which prints out file changes in unified diff
   format:
$ svn diff

===================================================================
--- stuff/things/bloo.h (revision 8)
+++ stuff/things/bloo.h (working copy)
+Here is a new file to describe
+things about bloo.

   The svn diff command produces this output by comparing your working
   files against the cached âpristineâ copies within the .svn area. Files
   scheduled for addition are displayed as all added text, and files
   scheduled for deletion are displayed as all deleted text.

   Output is displayed in unified diff format. That is, removed lines are
   prefaced with -, and added lines are prefaced with +. svn diff also
   prints filename and offset information useful to the patch program, so
   you can generate âpatchesâ by redirecting the diff output to a file:
$ svn diff > patchfile

   You could, for example, email the patch file to another developer for
   review or testing prior to a commit.

   Subversion uses its internal diff engine, which produces unified diff
   format, by default. If you want diff output in a different format,
   specify an external diff program using --diff-cmd and pass any flags
   you'd like to it using the --extensions (-x) option. For example, to
   see local differences in file foo.c in context output format while
   ignoring case differences, you might run svn diff --diff-cmd
   /usr/bin/diff --extensions '-i' foo.c.

Undoing Working Changes

   Suppose while viewing the output of svn diff you determine that all the
   changes you made to a particular file are mistakes. Maybe you shouldn't
   have changed the file at all, or perhaps it would be easier to make
   different changes starting from scratch.

   This is a perfect opportunity to use svn revert:
$ svn revert README
Reverted 'README'

   Subversion reverts the file to its premodified state by overwriting it
   with the cached âpristineâ copy from the .svn area. But also note that
   svn revert can undo any scheduled operationsâfor example, you might
   decide that you don't want to add a new file after all:
$ svn status foo
?      foo

$ svn add foo
A         foo

$ svn revert foo
Reverted 'foo'

$ svn status foo
?      foo

Note

   svn revert item has exactly the same effect as deleting item from your
   working copy and then running svn update -r BASE item. However, if
   you're reverting a file, svn revert has one very noticeable
   differenceâit doesn't have to communicate with the repository to
   restore your file.

   Or perhaps you mistakenly removed a file from version control:
$ svn status README

$ svn delete README
D         README

$ svn revert README
Reverted 'README'

$ svn status README

Resolve Conflicts (Merging Others' Changes)

   We've already seen how svn status -u can predict conflicts. Suppose you
   run svn update and some interesting things occur:
$ svn update
U  INSTALL
G  README
Conflict discovered in 'bar.c'.
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
        (h) help for more options:

   The U and G codes are no cause for concern; those files cleanly
   absorbed changes from the repository. The files marked with U contained
   no local changes but were Updated with changes from the repository. The
   G stands for merGed, which means that the file had local changes to
   begin with, but the changes coming from the repository didn't overlap
   with the local changes.

   But the next two lines are part of a feature (new in Subversion 1.5)
   called interactive conflict resolution. This means that the changes
   from the server overlapped with your own, and you have the opportunity
   to resolve this conflict. The most commonly used options are displayed,
   but you can see all of the options by typing h:
â¦
  (p)  postpone    - mark the conflict to be resolved later
  (df) diff-full   - show all changes made to merged file
  (e)  edit        - change merged file in an editor
  (r)  resolved    - accept merged version of file
  (mf) mine-full   - accept my version of entire file (ignore their changes)
  (tf) theirs-full - accept their version of entire file (lose my changes)
  (l)  launch      - launch external tool to resolve conflict
  (h)  help        - show this list

   Let's briefly review each of these options before we go into detail on
   what each option means.

   (p)ostpone
          Leave the file in a conflicted state for you to resolve after
          your update is complete.

   (d)iff
          Display the differences between the base revision and the
          conflicted file itself in unified diff format.

   (e)dit
          Open the file in conflict with your favorite editor, as set in
          the environment variable EDITOR.

   (r)esolved
          After editing a file, tell svn that you've resolved the
          conflicts in the file and that it should accept the current
          contentsâbasically that you've âresolvedâ the conflict.

   (m)ine-(f)ull
          Discard the newly received changes from the server and use only
          your local changes for the file under review.

   (t)heirs-(f)ull
          Discard your local changes to the file under review and use only
          the newly received changes from the server.

   (l)aunch
          Launch an external program to perform the conflict resolution.
          This requires a bit of preparation beforehand.

   (h)elp
          Show the list of all possible commands you can use in
          interactive conflict resolution.

   We'll cover these commands in more detail now, grouping them together
   by related functionality.

Viewing conflict differences interactively

   Before deciding how to attack a conflict interactively, odds are that
   you'd like to see exactly what is in conflict, and the diff command (d)
   is what you'll use for this:
â¦
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
        (h)elp for more options : d

   The first line of the diff content shows the previous contents of the
   working copy (the BASE revision), the next content line is your change,
   and the last content line is the change that was just received from the
   server (usually the HEAD revision). With this information in hand,
   you're ready to move on to the next action.

Resolving conflict differences interactively

   There are four different ways to resolve conflicts interactivelyâtwo of
   which allow you to selectively merge and edit changes, and two of which
   allow you to simply pick a version of the file and move along.

   If you wish to choose some combination of your local changes, you can
   use the âeditâ command (e) to manually edit the file with conflict
   markers in a text editor (determined by the EDITOR environment
   variable). Editing the file by hand in your favorite text editor is a
   somewhat low-tech way of remedying conflicts (see the section called
   âMerging conflicts by handâ for a walkthrough), so some people like to
   use fancy graphical merge tools instead.

   To use a merge tool, you need to either set the SVN_MERGE environment
   variable or define the merge-tool-cmd option in your Subversion
   configuration file (see the section called âConfiguration Optionsâ for
   more details). Subversion will pass four arguments to the merge tool:
   the BASE revision of the file, the revision of the file received from
   the server as part of the update, the copy of the file containing your
   local edits, and the merged copy of the file (which contains conflict
   markers). If your merge tool is expecting arguments in a different
   order or format, you'll need to write a wrapper script for Subversion
   to invoke. After you've edited the file, if you're satisfied with the
   changes you've made, you can tell Subversion that the edited file is no
   longer in conflict by using the âresolveâ command (r).

   If you decide that you don't need to merge any changes, but just want
   to accept one version of the file or the other, you can either choose
   your changes (a.k.a. âmineâ) by using the âmine-fullâ command (mf) or
   choose theirs by using the âtheirs-fullâ command (tf).

Postponing conflict resolution

   This may sound like an appropriate section for avoiding marital
   disagreements, but it's actually still about Subversion, so read on. If
   you're doing an update and encounter a conflict that you're not
   prepared to review or resolve, you can type p to postpone resolving a
   conflict on a file-by-file basis when you run svn update. If you're
   running an update and don't want to resolve any conflicts, you can pass
   the --non-interactive option to svn update, and any file in conflict
   will be marked with a C automatically.

   The C stands for conflict. This means that the changes from the server
   overlapped with your own, and now you have to manually choose between
   them after the update has completed. When you postpone a conflict
   resolution, svn typically does three things to assist you in noticing
   and resolving that conflict:
     * Subversion prints a C during the update and remembers that the file
       is in a state of conflict.
     * If Subversion considers the file to be mergeable, it places
       conflict markersâspecial strings of text that delimit the âsidesâ
       of the conflictâinto the file to visibly demonstrate the
       overlapping areas. (Subversion uses the svn:mime-type property to
       decide whether a file is capable of contextual, line-based merging.
       See the section called âFile Content Typeâ to learn more.)
     * For every conflicted file, Subversion places three extra
       unversioned files in your working copy:

        filename.mine
                This is your file as it existed in your working copy
                before you updated your working copyâthat is, without
                conflict markers. This file has only your latest changes
                in it. (If Subversion considers the file to be
                unmergeable, the .mine file isn't created, since it would
                be identical to the working file.)

        filename.rOLDREV
                This is the file that was the BASE revision before you
                updated your working copy. That is, the file that you
                checked out before you made your latest edits.

        filename.rNEWREV
                This is the file that your Subversion client just received
                from the server when you updated your working copy. This
                file corresponds to the HEAD revision of the repository.

       Here OLDREV is the revision number of the file in your .svn
       directory, and NEWREV is the revision number of the repository
       HEAD.

   For example, Sally makes changes to the file sandwich.txt, but does not
   yet commit those changes. Meanwhile, Harry commits changes to that same
   file. Sally updates her working copy before committing and she gets a
   conflict, which she postpones:
$ svn update
Conflict discovered in 'sandwich.txt'.
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
        (h)elp for more options : p
C  sandwich.txt
Updated to revision 2.
$ ls -1
sandwich.txt
sandwich.txt.mine
sandwich.txt.r1
sandwich.txt.r2

   At this point, Subversion will not allow Sally to commit the file
   sandwich.txt until the three temporary files are removed:
$ svn commit -m "Add a few more things"
svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: Aborting commit: '/home/sally/svn-work/sandwich.txt' remains in conflict

   If you've postponed a conflict, you need to resolve the conflict before
   Subversion will allow you to commit your changes. You'll do this with
   the svn resolve command and one of several arguments to the --accept
   option.

   If you want to choose the version of the file that you last checked out
   before making your edits, choose the base argument.

   If you want to choose the version that contains only your edits, choose
   the mine-full argument.

   If you want to choose the version that your most recent update pulled
   from the server (and thus discarding your edits entirely), choose the
   theirs-full argument.

   However, if you want to pick and choose from your changes and the
   changes that your update fetched from the server, merge the conflicted
   text âby handâ (by examining and editing the conflict markers within
   the file) and then choose the working argument.

   svn resolve removes the three temporary files and accepts the version
   of the file that you specified with the --accept option, and Subversion
   no longer considers the file to be in a state of conflict:
$ svn resolve --accept working sandwich.txt
Resolved conflicted state of 'sandwich.txt'

Merging conflicts by hand

   Merging conflicts by hand can be quite intimidating the first time you
   attempt it, but with a little practice, it can become as easy as
   falling off a bike.

   Here's an example. Due to a miscommunication, you and Sally, your
   collaborator, both edit the file sandwich.txt at the same time. Sally
   commits her changes, and when you go to update your working copy, you
   get a conflict and you're going to have to edit sandwich.txt to resolve
   the conflict. First, let's take a look at the file:
$ cat sandwich.txt

   are conflict markers and are not part of the actual data in conflict.
   You generally want to ensure that those are removed from the file
   before your next commit. The text between the first two sets of markers
   is composed of the changes you made in the conflicting area:
<<<<<<< .mine
Salami
Mortadella
Prosciutto
=======

   The text between the second and third sets of conflict markers is the
   text from Sally's commit:
=======
Sauerkraut
Grilled Chicken
>>>>>>> .r2

   Usually you won't want to just delete the conflict markers and Sally's
   changesâshe's going to be awfully surprised when the sandwich arrives
   and it's not what she wanted. This is where you pick up the phone or
   walk across the office and explain to Sally that you can't get
   sauerkraut from an Italian deli. ^[6] Once you've agreed on the changes
   you will commit, edit your file and remove the conflict markers:
Top piece of bread
Mayonnaise
Lettuce
Tomato
Provolone
Salami
Mortadella
Prosciutto
Creole Mustard
Bottom piece of bread

   Now use svn resolve, and you're ready to commit your changes:
$ svn resolve --accept working sandwich.txt
Resolved conflicted state of 'sandwich.txt'
$ svn commit -m "Go ahead and use my sandwich, discarding Sally's edits."

   Note that svn resolve, unlike most of the other commands we deal with
   in this chapter, requires that you explicitly list any filenames that
   you wish to resolve. In any case, you want to be careful and use svn
   resolve only when you're certain that you've fixed the conflict in your
   fileâonce the temporary files are removed, Subversion will let you
   commit the file even if it still contains conflict markers.

   If you ever get confused while editing the conflicted file, you can
   always consult the three files that Subversion creates for you in your
   working copyâincluding your file as it was before you updated. You can
   even use a third-party interactive merging tool to examine those three
   files.

Discarding your changes in favor of a newly fetched revision

   If you get a conflict and decide that you want to throw out your
   changes, you can run svn resolve --accept theirs-full CONFLICTED-PATH
   and Subversion will discard your edits and remove the temporary files:
$ svn update
Conflict discovered in 'sandwich.txt'.
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
        (h) help for more options: p
C    sandwich.txt
Updated to revision 2.
$ ls sandwich.*
sandwich.txt  sandwich.txt.mine  sandwich.txt.r2  sandwich.txt.r1
$ svn resolve --accept theirs-full sandwich.txt
Resolved conflicted state of 'sandwich.txt'

Punting: Using svn revert

   If you decide that you want to throw out your changes and start your
   edits again (whether this occurs after a conflict or anytime), just
   revert your changes:
$ svn revert sandwich.txt
Reverted 'sandwich.txt'
$ ls sandwich.*
sandwich.txt

   Note that when you revert a conflicted file, you don't have to use svn
   resolve.

Commit Your Changes

   Finally! Your edits are finished, you've merged all changes from the
   server, and you're ready to commit your changes to the repository.

   The svn commit command sends all of your changes to the repository.
   When you commit a change, you need to supply a log message describing
   your change. Your log message will be attached to the new revision you
   create. If your log message is brief, you may wish to supply it on the
   command line using the --message (or -m) option:
$ svn commit -m "Corrected number of cheese slices."
Sending        sandwich.txt
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 3.

   However, if you've been composing your log message as you work, you may
   want to tell Subversion to get the message from a file by passing the
   filename with the --file (-F) option:
$ svn commit -F logmsg
Sending        sandwich.txt
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 4.

   If you fail to specify either the --message or --file option,
   Subversion will automatically launch your favorite editor (see the
   information on editor-cmd in the section called âConfigâ) for composing
   a log message.

Tip

   If you're in your editor writing a commit message and decide that you
   want to cancel your commit, you can just quit your editor without
   saving changes. If you've already saved your commit message, simply
   delete the text, save again, and then abort:
$ svn commit
Waiting for Emacs...Done

Log message unchanged or not specified
(a)bort, (c)ontinue, (e)dit
a
$

   The repository doesn't know or care whether your changes make any sense
   as a whole; it checks only to make sure nobody else has changed any of
   the same files that you did when you weren't looking. If somebody has
   done that, the entire commit will fail with a message informing you
   that one or more of your files are out of date:
$ svn commit -m "Add another rule"
Sending        rules.txt
svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: File '/sandwich.txt' is out of date
â¦

   (The exact wording of this error message depends on the network
   protocol and server you're using, but the idea is the same in all
   cases.)

   At this point, you need to run svn update, deal with any merges or
   conflicts that result, and attempt your commit again.

   That covers the basic work cycle for using Subversion. Subversion
   offers many other features that you can use to manage your repository
   and working copy, but most of your day-to-day use of Subversion will
   involve only the commands that we've discussed so far in this chapter.
   We will, however, cover a few more commands that you'll use fairly
   often.

Examining History

   Your Subversion repository is like a time machine. It keeps a record of
   every change ever committed and allows you to explore this history by
   examining previous versions of files and directories as well as the
   metadata that accompanies them. With a single Subversion command, you
   can check out the repository (or restore an existing working copy)
   exactly as it was at any date or revision number in the past. However,
   sometimes you just want to peer into the past instead of going into it.

   Several commands can provide you with historical data from the
   repository:

   svn log
          Shows you broad information: log messages with date and author
          information attached to revisions and which paths changed in
          each revision

   svn diff
          Shows line-level details of a particular change

   svn cat
          Retrieves a file as it existed in a particular revision number
          and displays it on your screen

   svn list
          Displays the files in a directory for any given revision

Generating a List of Historical Changes

   To find information about the history of a file or directory, use the
   svn log command. svn log will provide you with a record of who made
   changes to a file or directory, at what revision it changed, the time
   and date of that revision, andâif it was providedâthe log message that
   accompanied the commit:
$ svn log
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r3 | sally | 2008-05-15 23:09:28 -0500 (Thu, 15 May 2008) | 1 line

Added include lines and corrected # of cheese slices.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r2 | harry | 2008-05-14 18:43:15 -0500 (Wed, 14 May 2008) | 1 line

Added main() methods.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r1 | sally | 2008-05-10 19:50:31 -0500 (Sat, 10 May 2008) | 1 line

Initial import
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Note that the log messages are printed in reverse chronological order
   by default. If you wish to see a different range of revisions in a
   particular order or just a single revision, pass the --revision (-r)
   option:
$ svn log -r 5:19    # shows logs 5 through 19 in chronological order

$ svn log -r 19:5    # shows logs 5 through 19 in reverse order

$ svn log -r 8       # shows log for revision 8

   You can also examine the log history of a single file or directory. For
   example:
$ svn log foo.c
â¦
$ svn log http://foo.com/svn/trunk/code/foo.c
â¦

   These will display log messages only for those revisions in which the
   working file (or URL) changed.

   Why Does svn log Not Show Me What I Just Committed?

   If you make a commit and immediately type svn log with no arguments,
   you may notice that your most recent commit doesn't show up in the list
   of log messages. This is due to a combination of the behavior of svn
   commit and the default behavior of svn log. First, when you commit
   changes to the repository, svn bumps only the revision of files (and
   directories) that it commits, so usually the parent directory remains
   at the older revision (See the section called âUpdates and commits are
   separateâ for an explanation of why). svn log then defaults to fetching
   the history of the directory at its current revision, and thus you
   don't see the newly committed changes. The solution here is to either
   update your working copy or explicitly provide a revision number to svn
   log by using the --revision (-r) option.

   If you want even more information about a file or directory, svn log
   also takes a --verbose (-v) option. Because Subversion allows you to
   move and copy files and directories, it is important to be able to
   track path changes in the filesystem. So, in verbose mode, svn log will
   include a list of changed paths in a revision in its output:
$ svn log -r 8 -v
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r8 | sally | 2008-05-21 13:19:25 -0500 (Wed, 21 May 2008) | 1 line
Changed paths:
   M /trunk/code/foo.c
   M /trunk/code/bar.h
   A /trunk/code/doc/README

Frozzled the sub-space winch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   svn log also takes a --quiet (-q) option, which suppresses the body of
   the log message. When combined with --verbose, it gives just the names
   of the changed files.

   Why Does svn log Give Me an Empty Response?

   After working with Subversion for a bit, most users will come across
   something like this:
$ svn log -r 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$

   At first glance, this seems like an error. But recall that while
   revisions are repository-wide, svn log operates on a path in the
   repository. If you supply no path, Subversion uses the current working
   directory as the default target. As a result, if you're operating in a
   subdirectory of your working copy and attempt to see the log of a
   revision in which neither that directory nor any of its children was
   changed, Subversion will show you an empty log. If you want to see what
   changed in that revision, try pointing svn log directly at the topmost
   URL of your repository, as in svn log -r 2
   http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn.

Examining the Details of Historical Changes

   We've already seen svn diff beforeâit displays file differences in
   unified diff format; we used it to show the local modifications made to
   our working copy before committing to the repository.

   In fact, it turns out that there are three distinct uses of svn diff:
     * Examining local changes
     * Comparing your working copy to the repository
     * Comparing repository revisions

Examining local changes

   As we've seen, invoking svn diff with no options will compare your
   working files to the cached âpristineâ copies in the .svn area:
$ svn diff
Index: rules.txt
===================================================================
--- rules.txt   (revision 3)
+++ rules.txt   (working copy)

Comparing working copy to repository

   If a single --revision (-r) number is passed, your working copy is
   compared to the specified revision in the repository:
$ svn diff -r 3 rules.txt
Index: rules.txt
===================================================================
--- rules.txt   (revision 3)

@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@

+Chew with your mouth closed
+Listen when others are speaking
$

Comparing repository revisions

   If two revision numbers, separated by a colon, are passed via
   --revision (-r), the two revisions are directly compared:
$ svn diff -r 2:3 rules.txt
Index: rules.txt
===================================================================
--- rules.txt   (revision 2)
+++ rules.txt   (revision 3)
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@

$

   A more convenient way of comparing one revision to the previous
   revision is to use the --change (-c) option:
$ svn diff -c 3 rules.txt
Index: rules.txt
===================================================================
--- rules.txt   (revision 2)
+++ rules.txt   (revision 3)
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@

$

   Lastly, you can compare repository revisions even when you don't have a
   working copy on your local machine, just by including the appropriate
   URL on the command line:
$ svn diff -c 5 http://svn.example.com/repos/example/trunk/text/rules.txt
â¦
$

Browsing the Repository

   Using svn cat and svn list, you can view various revisions of files and
   directories without changing the working revision of your working copy.
   In fact, you don't even need a working copy to use either one.

svn cat

   If you want to examine an earlier version of a file and not necessarily
   the differences between two files, you can use svn cat:
$ svn cat -r 2 rules.txt
Be kind to others
Freedom = Chocolate Ice Cream
Everything in moderation
Chew with your mouth open
$

   You can also redirect the output directly into a file:
$ svn cat -r 2 rules.txt > rules.txt.v2
$

svn list

   The svn list command shows you what files are in a repository directory
   without actually downloading the files to your local machine:
$ svn list http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn
README
branches/
clients/
tags/
trunk/

   If you want a more detailed listing, pass the --verbose (-v) flag to
   get output like this:
$ svn list -v http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn
  20620 harry            1084 Jul 13  2006 README
  23339 harry                 Feb 04 01:40 branches/
  21282 sally                 Aug 27 09:41 developer-resources/
  23198 harry                 Jan 23 17:17 tags/
  23351 sally                 Feb 05 13:26 trunk/

   The columns tell you the revision at which the file or directory was
   last modified, the user who modified it, the size if it is a file, the
   date it was last modified, and the item's name.

Warning

   The svn list command with no arguments defaults to the repository URL
   of the current working directory, not the local working copy directory.
   After all, if you want a listing of your local directory, you could use
   just plain ls (or any reasonable non-Unixy equivalent).

Fetching Older Repository Snapshots

   In addition to all of the previous commands, you can use svn update and
   svn checkout with the --revision option to take an entire working copy
   âback in timeâ: ^[7]
$ svn checkout -r 1729 # Checks out a new working copy at r1729
â¦
$ svn update -r 1729 # Updates an existing working copy to r1729
â¦

Tip

   Many Subversion newcomers attempt to use the preceding svn update
   example to âundoâ committed changes, but this won't work as you can't
   commit changes that you obtain from backdating a working copy if the
   changed files have newer revisions. See the section called
   âResurrecting Deleted Itemsâ for a description of how to âundoâ a
   commit.

   Lastly, if you're building a release and wish to bundle up your files
   from Subversion but don't want those pesky .svn directories in the way,
   you can use svn export to create a local copy of all or part of your
   repository sans .svn directories. As with svn update and svn checkout,
   you can also pass the --revision option to svn export:
$ svn export http://svn.example.com/svn/repos1 # Exports latest revision
â¦
$ svn export http://svn.example.com/svn/repos1 -r 1729
# Exports revision r1729
â¦

Sometimes You Just Need to Clean Up

   Now that we've covered the day-to-day tasks that you'll frequently use
   Subversion for, we'll review a few administrative tasks relating to
   your working copy.

Disposing of a Working Copy

   Subversion doesn't track either the state or the existence of working
   copies on the server, so there's no server overhead to keeping working
   copies around. Likewise, there's no need to let the server know that
   you're going to delete a working copy.

   If you're likely to use a working copy again, there's nothing wrong
   with just leaving it on disk until you're ready to use it again, at
   which point all it takes is an svn update to bring it up to date and
   ready for use.

   However, if you're definitely not going to use a working copy again,
   you can safely delete the entire thing, but you'd be well served to
   take a look through the working copy for unversioned files. To find
   these files, run svn status and review any files that are prefixed with
   a ? to make certain that they're not of importance. After you're done
   reviewing, you can safely delete your working copy.

Recovering from an Interruption

   When Subversion modifies your working copy (or any information within
   .svn), it tries to do so as safely as possible. Before changing the
   working copy, Subversion writes its intentions to a logfile. Next, it
   executes the commands in the logfile to apply the requested change,
   holding a lock on the relevant part of the working copy while it
   worksâto prevent other Subversion clients from accessing the working
   copy mid-change. Finally, Subversion removes the logfile.
   Architecturally, this is similar to a journaled filesystem. If a
   Subversion operation is interrupted (e.g, if the process is killed or
   if the machine crashes), the logfiles remain on disk. By reexecuting
   the logfiles, Subversion can complete the previously started operation,
   and your working copy can get itself back into a consistent state.

   And this is exactly what svn cleanup does: it searches your working
   copy and runs any leftover logs, removing working copy locks in the
   process. If Subversion ever tells you that some part of your working
   copy is âlocked,â this is the command that you should run. Also, svn
   status will display an L next to locked items:
$ svn status
  L    somedir
M      somedir/foo.c

$ svn cleanup
$ svn status
M      somedir/foo.c

   Don't confuse these working copy locks with the ordinary locks that
   Subversion users create when using the lock-modify-unlock model of
   concurrent version control; see the sidebar The Three Meanings of
   âLockâ for clarification.

Summary

   Now we've covered most of the Subversion client commands. Notable
   exceptions are those dealing with branching and merging (see Chapter 4,
   Branching and Merging) and properties (see the section called
   âPropertiesâ). However, you may want to take a moment to skim through
   Chapter 9, Subversion Complete Reference to get an idea of all the
   different commands that Subversion hasâand how you can use them to make
   your work easier.
   __________________________________________________________________

   ^[3] Of course, you're not terribly worriedâfirst because you know that
   you can't really delete anything from Subversion, and second because
   your Subversion password isn't the same as any of the other 3 million
   passwords you have, right? Right?

   ^[4] Of course, nothing is ever totally deleted from the
   repositoryâjust from the HEAD of the repository. You can get back
   anything you delete by checking out (or updating your working copy to)
   a revision earlier than the one in which you deleted it. Also see the
   section called âResurrecting Deleted Itemsâ.

   ^[5] And you don't have a WLAN card. Thought you got us, huh?

   ^[6] And if you ask them for it, they may very well ride you out of
   town on a rail.

   ^[7] See? We told you that Subversion was a time machine.

   Summary

   If you've been reading this book chapter by chapter, from start to
   finish, you should by now have acquired enough knowledge to use the
   Subversion client to perform the most common version control
   operations. You understand how to check out a working copy from a
   Subversion repository. You are comfortable with submitting and
   receiving changes using the svn commit and svn update operations.
   You've probably even developed a reflex that causes you to run the svn
   status command almost unconsciously. For all intents and purposes, you
   are ready to use Subversion in a typical environment.

   But the Subversion feature set doesn't stop at âcommon version control
   operations.â It has other bits of functionality besides just
   communicating file and directory changes to and from a central
   repository.

   This chapter highlights some of Subversion's features that, while
   important, aren't part of the typical user's daily routine. It assumes
   that you are familiar with Subversion's basic file and directory
   versioning capabilities. If you aren't, you'll want to first read
   Chapter 1, Fundamental Concepts and Chapter 2, Basic Usage. Once you've
   mastered those basics and consumed this chapter, you'll be a Subversion
   power user!

Revision Specifiers

   As we described in the section called âRevisionsâ, revision numbers in
   Subversion are pretty straightforwardâintegers that keep getting larger
   as you commit more changes to your versioned data. Still, it doesn't
   take long before you can no longer remember exactly what happened in
   each and every revision. Fortunately, the typical Subversion workflow
   doesn't often demand that you supply arbitrary revisions to the
   Subversion operations you perform. For operations that do require a
   revision specifier, you generally supply a revision number that you saw
   in a commit email, in the output of some other Subversion operation, or
   in some other context that would give meaning to that particular
   number.

   But occasionally, you need to pinpoint a moment in time for which you
   don't already have a revision number memorized or handy. So besides the
   integer revision numbers, svn allows as input some additional forms of
   revision specifiers: revision keywords and revision dates.

Note

   The various forms of Subversion revision specifiers can be mixed and
   matched when used to specify revision ranges. For example, you can use
   -r REV1:REV2 where REV1 is a revision keyword and REV2 is a revision
   number, or where REV1 is a date and REV2 is a revision keyword, and so
   on. The individual revision specifiers are independently evaluated, so
   you can put whatever you want on the opposite sides of that colon.

Revision Keywords

   The Subversion client understands a number of revision keywords. These
   keywords can be used instead of integer arguments to the --revision
   (-r) option, and are resolved into specific revision numbers by
   Subversion:

   HEAD
          The latest (or âyoungestâ) revision in the repository.

   BASE
          The revision number of an item in a working copy. If the item
          has been locally modified, this refers to the way the item
          appears without those local modifications.

   COMMITTED
          The most recent revision prior to, or equal to, BASE, in which
          an item changed.

   PREV
          The revision immediately before the last revision in which an
          item changed. Technically, this boils down to COMMITTEDâ1.

   As can be derived from their descriptions, the PREV, BASE, and
   COMMITTED revision keywords are used only when referring to a working
   copy pathâthey don't apply to repository URLs. HEAD, on the other hand,
   can be used in conjunction with both of these path types.

   Here are some examples of revision keywords in action:
$ svn diff -r PREV:COMMITTED foo.c
# shows the last change committed to foo.c

$ svn log -r HEAD
# shows log message for the latest repository commit

$ svn diff -r HEAD
# compares your working copy (with all of its local changes) to the
# latest version of that tree in the repository

$ svn diff -r BASE:HEAD foo.c
# compares the unmodified version of foo.c with the latest version of
# foo.c in the repository

$ svn log -r BASE:HEAD
# shows all commit logs for the current versioned directory since you
# last updated

$ svn update -r PREV foo.c
# rewinds the last change on foo.c, decreasing foo.c's working revision

$ svn diff -r BASE:14 foo.c
# compares the unmodified version of foo.c with the way foo.c looked
# in revision 14

Revision Dates

   Revision numbers reveal nothing about the world outside the version
   control system, but sometimes you need to correlate a moment in real
   time with a moment in version history. To facilitate this, the
   --revision (-r) option can also accept as input date specifiers wrapped
   in curly braces ({ and }). Subversion accepts the standard ISO-8601
   date and time formats, plus a few others. Here are some examples.
   (Remember to use quotes around any date that contains spaces.)
$ svn checkout -r {2006-02-17}
$ svn checkout -r {15:30}
$ svn checkout -r {15:30:00.200000}
$ svn checkout -r {"2006-02-17 15:30"}
$ svn checkout -r {"2006-02-17 15:30 +0230"}
$ svn checkout -r {2006-02-17T15:30}
$ svn checkout -r {2006-02-17T15:30Z}
$ svn checkout -r {2006-02-17T15:30-04:00}
$ svn checkout -r {20060217T1530}
$ svn checkout -r {20060217T1530Z}
$ svn checkout -r {20060217T1530-0500}
â¦

   When you specify a date, Subversion resolves that date to the most
   recent revision of the repository as of that date, and then continues
   to operate against that resolved revision number:
$ svn log -r {2006-11-28}

   Is Subversion a Day Early?

   If you specify a single date as a revision without specifying a time of
   day (for example 2006-11-27), you may think that Subversion should give
   you the last revision that took place on the 27th of November. Instead,
   you'll get back a revision from the 26th, or even earlier. Remember
   that Subversion will find the most recent revision of the repository as
   of the date you give. If you give a date without a timestamp, such as
   2006-11-27, Subversion assumes a time of 00:00:00, so looking for the
   most recent revision won't return anything on the 27th.

   If you want to include the 27th in your search, you can either specify
   the 27th with the time ({"2006-11-27 23:59"}), or just specify the next
   day ({2006-11-28}).

   You can also use a range of dates. Subversion will find all revisions
   between both dates, inclusive:
$ svn log -r {2006-11-20}:{2006-11-29}
â¦

Warning

   Since the timestamp of a revision is stored as an unversioned,
   modifiable property of the revision (see the section called
   âPropertiesâ), revision timestamps can be changed to represent complete
   falsifications of true chronology, or even removed altogether.
   Subversion's ability to correctly convert revision dates into real
   revision numbers depends on revision datestamps maintaining a
   sequential orderingâthe younger the revision, the younger its
   timestamp. If this ordering isn't maintained, you will likely find that
   trying to use dates to specify revision ranges in your repository
   doesn't always return the data you might have expected.

Properties

   We've already covered in detail how Subversion stores and retrieves
   various versions of files and directories in its repository. Whole
   chapters have been devoted to this most fundamental piece of
   functionality provided by the tool. And if the versioning support
   stopped there, Subversion would still be complete from a version
   control perspective.

   But it doesn't stop there.

   In addition to versioning your directories and files, Subversion
   provides interfaces for adding, modifying, and removing versioned
   metadata on each of your versioned directories and files. We refer to
   this metadata as properties, and they can be thought of as two-column
   tables that map property names to arbitrary values attached to each
   item in your working copy. Generally speaking, the names and values of
   the properties can be whatever you want them to be, with the constraint
   that the names must contain only ASCII characters. And the best part
   about these properties is that they, too, are versioned, just like the
   textual contents of your files. You can modify, commit, and revert
   property changes as easily as you can file content changes. And the
   sending and receiving of property changes occurs as part of your
   typical commit and update operationsâyou don't have to change your
   basic processes to accommodate them.

Note

   Subversion has reserved the set of properties whose names begin with
   svn: as its own. While there are only a handful of such properties in
   use today, you should avoid creating custom properties for your own
   needs whose names begin with this prefix. Otherwise, you run the risk
   that a future release of Subversion will grow support for a feature or
   behavior driven by a property of the same name but with perhaps an
   entirely different interpretation.

   Properties show up elsewhere in Subversion, too. Just as files and
   directories may have arbitrary property names and values attached to
   them, each revision as a whole may have arbitrary properties attached
   to it. The same constraints applyâhuman-readable names and
   anything-you-want binary values. The main difference is that revision
   properties are not versioned. In other words, if you change the value
   of, or delete, a revision property, there's no way, within the scope of
   Subversion's functionality, to recover the previous value.

   Subversion has no particular policy regarding the use of properties. It
   asks only that you not use property names that begin with the prefix
   svn:. That's the namespace that it sets aside for its own use. And
   Subversion does, in fact, use propertiesâboth the versioned and
   unversioned variety. Certain versioned properties have special meaning
   or effects when found on files and directories, or they house a
   particular bit of information about the revisions on which they are
   found. Certain revision properties are automatically attached to
   revisions by Subversion's commit process, and they carry information
   about the revision. Most of these properties are mentioned elsewhere in
   this or other chapters as part of the more general topics to which they
   are related. For an exhaustive list of Subversion's predefined
   properties, see the section called âSubversion Propertiesâ.

   In this section, we will examine the utilityâboth to users of
   Subversion and to Subversion itselfâof property support. You'll learn
   about the property-related svn subcommands and how property
   modifications affect your normal Subversion workflow.

Why Properties?

   Just as Subversion uses properties to store extra information about the
   files, directories, and revisions that it contains, you might also find
   properties to be of similar use. You might find it useful to have a
   place close to your versioned data to hang custom metadata about that
   data.

   Say you wish to design a web site that houses many digital photos and
   displays them with captions and a datestamp. Now, your set of photos is
   constantly changing, so you'd like to have as much of this site
   automated as possible. These photos can be quite large, so as is common
   with sites of this nature, you want to provide smaller thumbnail images
   to your site visitors.

   Now, you can get this functionality using traditional files. That is,
   you can have your image123.jpg and an image123-thumbnail.jpg side by
   side in a directory. Or if you want to keep the filenames the same, you
   might have your thumbnails in a different directory, such as
   thumbnails/image123.jpg. You can also store your captions and
   datestamps in a similar fashion, again separated from the original
   image file. But the problem here is that your collection of files
   multiplies with each new photo added to the site.

   Now consider the same web site deployed in a way that makes use of
   Subversion's file properties. Imagine having a single image file,
   image123.jpg, with properties set on that file that are named caption,
   datestamp, and even thumbnail. Now your working copy directory looks
   much more manageableâin fact, it looks to the casual browser like there
   are nothing but image files in it. But your automation scripts know
   better. They know that they can use svn (or better yet, they can use
   the Subversion language bindingsâsee the section called âUsing the
   APIsâ) to dig out the extra information that your site needs to display
   without having to read an index file or play path manipulation games.

Note

   While Subversion places few restrictions on the names and values you
   use for properties, it has not been designed to optimally carry large
   property values or large sets of properties on a given file or
   directory. Subversion commonly holds all the property names and values
   associated with a single item in memory at the same time, which can
   cause detrimental performance or failed operations when extremely large
   property sets are used.

   Custom revision properties are also frequently used. One common such
   use is a property whose value contains an issue tracker ID with which
   the revision is associated, perhaps because the change made in that
   revision fixes a bug filed in the tracker issue with that ID. Other
   uses include hanging more friendly names on the revisionâit might be
   hard to remember that revision 1935 was a fully tested revision. But if
   there's, say, a test-results property on that revision with the value
   all passing, that's meaningful information to have.

   Searchability (or, Why Not Properties)

   For all their utility, Subversion propertiesâor, more accurately, the
   available interfaces to themâhave a major shortcoming: while it is a
   simple matter to set a custom property, finding that property later is
   a whole different ball of wax.

   Trying to locate a custom revision property generally involves
   performing a linear walk across all the revisions of the repository,
   asking of each revision, "Do you have the property I'm looking for?"
   Trying to find a custom versioned property is painful, too, and often
   involves a recursive svn propget across an entire working copy. In your
   situation, that might not be as bad as a linear walk across all
   revisions. But it certainly leaves much to be desired in terms of both
   performance and likelihood of success, especially if the scope of your
   search would require a working copy from the root of your repository.

   For this reason, you might chooseâespecially in the revision property
   use caseâto simply add your metadata to the revision's log message
   using some policy-driven (and perhaps programmatically enforced)
   formatting that is designed to be quickly parsed from the output of svn
   log. It is quite common to see the following in Subversion log
   messages:
Issue(s): IZ2376, IZ1919
Reviewed by:  sally

This fixes a nasty segfault in the wort frabbing process
â¦

   But here again lies some misfortune. Subversion doesn't yet provide a
   log message templating mechanism, which would go a long way toward
   helping users be consistent with the formatting of their log-embedded
   revision metadata.

Manipulating Properties

   The svn program affords a few ways to add or modify file and directory
   properties. For properties with short, human-readable values, perhaps
   the simplest way to add a new property is to specify the property name
   and value on the command line of the svn propset subcommand:
$ svn propset copyright '(c) 2006 Red-Bean Software' calc/button.c
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/button.c'
$

   But we've been touting the flexibility that Subversion offers for your
   property values. And if you are planning to have a multiline textual,
   or even binary, property value, you probably do not want to supply that
   value on the command line. So the svn propset subcommand takes a --file
   (-F) option for specifying the name of a file that contains the new
   property value.
$ svn propset license -F /path/to/LICENSE calc/button.c
property 'license' set on 'calc/button.c'
$

   There are some restrictions on the names you can use for properties. A
   property name must start with a letter, a colon (:), or an underscore
   (_); after that, you can also use digits, hyphens (-), and periods (.).
   ^[8]

   In addition to the propset command, the svn program supplies the
   propedit command. This command uses the configured editor program (see
   the section called âConfigâ) to add or modify properties. When you run
   the command, svn invokes your editor program on a temporary file that
   contains the current value of the property (or that is empty, if you
   are adding a new property). Then, you just modify that value in your
   editor program until it represents the new value you wish to store for
   the property, save the temporary file, and then exit the editor
   program. If Subversion detects that you've actually changed the
   existing value of the property, it will accept that as the new property
   value. If you exit your editor without making any changes, no property
   modification will occur:
$ svn propedit copyright calc/button.c  ### exit the editor without changes
No changes to property 'copyright' on 'calc/button.c'
$

   We should note that, as with other svn subcommands, those related to
   properties can act on multiple paths at once. This enables you to
   modify properties on whole sets of files with a single command. For
   example, we could have done the following:
$ svn propset copyright '(c) 2006 Red-Bean Software' calc/*
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/Makefile'
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/button.c'
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/integer.c'
â¦
$

   All of this property adding and editing isn't really very useful if you
   can't easily get the stored property value. So the svn program supplies
   two subcommands for displaying the names and values of properties
   stored on files and directories. The svn proplist command will list the
   names of properties that exist on a path. Once you know the names of
   the properties on the node, you can request their values individually
   using svn propget. This command will, given a property name and a path
   (or set of paths), print the value of the property to the standard
   output stream.
$ svn proplist calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':
  copyright
  license
$ svn propget copyright calc/button.c
(c) 2006 Red-Bean Software

   There's even a variation of the proplist command that will list both
   the name and the value for all of the properties. Simply supply the
   --verbose (-v) option.
$ svn proplist -v calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':
  copyright : (c) 2006 Red-Bean Software

â¦

   The last property-related subcommand is propdel. Since Subversion
   allows you to store properties with empty values, you can't remove a
   property altogether using svn propedit or svn propset. For example,
   this command will not yield the desired effect:
$ svn propset license '' calc/button.c
property 'license' set on 'calc/button.c'
$ svn proplist -v calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':
  copyright : (c) 2006 Red-Bean Software
  license :
$

   You need to use the propdel subcommand to delete properties altogether.
   The syntax is similar to the other property commands:
$ svn propdel license calc/button.c
property 'license' deleted from 'calc/button.c'.
$ svn proplist -v calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':
  copyright : (c) 2006 Red-Bean Software
$

   Remember those unversioned revision properties? You can modify those,
   too, using the same svn subcommands that we just described. Simply add
   the --revprop command-line parameter and specify the revision whose
   property you wish to modify. Since revisions are global, you don't need
   to specify a target path to these property-related commands so long as
   you are positioned in a working copy of the repository whose revision
   property you wish to modify. Otherwise, you can simply provide the URL
   of any path in the repository of interest (including the repository's
   root URL). For example, you might want to replace the commit log
   message of an existing revision. ^[9] If your current working directory
   is part of a working copy of your repository, you can simply run the
   svn propset command with no target path:
$ svn propset svn:log '* button.c: Fix a compiler warning.' -r11 --revprop
property 'svn:log' set on repository revision '11'
$

   But even if you haven't checked out a working copy from that
   repository, you can still effect the property change by providing the
   repository's root URL:
$ svn propset svn:log '* button.c: Fix a compiler warning.' -r11 --revprop \
              http://svn.example.com/repos/project
property 'svn:log' set on repository revision '11'
$

   Note that the ability to modify these unversioned properties must be
   explicitly added by the repository administrator (see the section
   called âCommit Log Message Correctionâ). That's because the properties
   aren't versioned, so you run the risk of losing information if you
   aren't careful with your edits. The repository administrator can set up
   methods to protect against this loss, and by default, modification of
   unversioned properties is disabled.

Tip

   Users should, where possible, use svn propedit instead of svn propset.
   While the end result of the commands is identical, the former will
   allow them to see the current value of the property that they are about
   to change, which helps them to verify that they are, in fact, making
   the change they think they are making. This is especially true when
   modifying unversioned revision properties. Also, it is significantly
   easier to modify multiline property values in a text editor than at the
   command line.

Properties and the Subversion Workflow

   Now that you are familiar with all of the property-related svn
   subcommands, let's see how property modifications affect the usual
   Subversion workflow. As we mentioned earlier, file and directory
   properties are versioned, just like your file contents. As a result,
   Subversion provides the same opportunities for mergingâcleanly or with
   conflictsâsomeone else's modifications into your own.

   As with file contents, your property changes are local modifications,
   made permanent only when you commit them to the repository with svn
   commit. Your property changes can be easily unmade, tooâthe svn revert
   command will restore your files and directories to their unedited
   statesâcontents, properties, and all. Also, you can receive interesting
   information about the state of your file and directory properties by
   using the svn status and svn diff commands.
$ svn status calc/button.c
 M     calc/button.c
$ svn diff calc/button.c
Property changes on: calc/button.c
___________________________________________________________________
Name: copyright
   + (c) 2006 Red-Bean Software

$

   Notice how the status subcommand displays M in the second column
   instead of the first. That is because we have modified the properties
   on calc/button.c, but not its textual contents. Had we changed both, we
   would have seen M in the first column, too. (We cover svn status in the
   section called âSee an overview of your changesâ).

   Property Conflicts

   As with file contents, local property modifications can conflict with
   changes committed by someone else. If you update your working copy
   directory and receive property changes on a versioned object that clash
   with your own, Subversion will report that the object is in a
   conflicted state.
$ svn update calc
M  calc/Makefile.in
Conflict for property 'linecount' discovered on 'calc/button.c'.
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
        (s) show all options: p
 C calc/button.c
Updated to revision 143.
$

   Subversion will also create, in the same directory as the conflicted
   object, a file with a .prej extension that contains the details of the
   conflict. You should examine the contents of this file so you can
   decide how to resolve the conflict. Until the conflict is resolved, you
   will see a C in the second column of svn status output for that object,
   and attempts to commit your local modifications will fail.
$ svn status calc
 C     calc/button.c
?      calc/button.c.prej
$ cat calc/button.c.prej
Trying to change property 'linecount' from '1267' to '1301',
but property has been locally changed from '1267' to '1256'.
$

   To resolve property conflicts, simply ensure that the conflicting
   properties contain the values that they should, and then use the svn
   resolved command to alert Subversion that you have manually resolved
   the problem.

   You might also have noticed the nonstandard way that Subversion
   currently displays property differences. You can still use svn diff and
   redirect its output to create a usable patch file. The patch program
   will ignore property patchesâas a rule, it ignores any noise it can't
   understand. This does, unfortunately, mean that to fully apply a patch
   generated by svn diff, any property modifications will need to be
   applied by hand.

Automatic Property Setting

   Properties are a powerful feature of Subversion, acting as key
   components of many Subversion features discussed elsewhere in this and
   other chaptersâtextual diff and merge support, keyword substitution,
   newline translation, and so on. But to get the full benefit of
   properties, they must be set on the right files and directories.
   Unfortunately, that step can be easily forgotten in the routine of
   things, especially since failing to set a property doesn't usually
   result in an obvious error (at least compared to, say, failing to add a
   file to version control). To help your properties get applied to the
   places that need them, Subversion provides a couple of simple but
   useful features.

   Whenever you introduce a file to version control using the svn add or
   svn import commands, Subversion tries to assist by setting some common
   file properties automatically. First, on operating systems whose
   filesystems support an execute permission bit, Subversion will
   automatically set the svn:executable property on newly added or
   imported files whose execute bit is enabled. (See the section called
   âFile Executabilityâ later in this chapter for more about this
   property.)

   Second, Subversion tries to determine the file's MIME type. If you've
   configured a mime-types-files runtime configuration parameter,
   Subversion will try to find a MIME type mapping in that file for your
   file's extension. If it finds such a mapping, it will set your file's
   svn:mime-type property to the MIME type it found. If no mapping file is
   configured, or no mapping for your file's extension could be found,
   Subversion runs a very basic heuristic to determine whether the file
   contains nontextual content. If so, it automatically sets the
   svn:mime-type property on that file to application/octet-stream (the
   generic âthis is a collection of bytesâ MIME type). Of course, if
   Subversion guesses incorrectly, or if you wish to set the svn:mime-type
   property to something more preciseâperhaps image/png or
   application/x-shockwave-flashâyou can always remove or edit that
   property. (For more on Subversion's use of MIME types, see the section
   called âFile Content Typeâ later in this chapter.)

   Subversion also provides, via its runtime configuration system (see the
   section called âRuntime Configuration Areaâ), a more flexible automatic
   property setting feature that allows you to create mappings of filename
   patterns to property names and values. Once again, these mappings
   affect adds and imports, and can not only override the default MIME
   type decision made by Subversion during those operations, but can also
   set additional Subversion or custom properties, too. For example, you
   might create a mapping that says that anytime you add JPEG filesâones
   whose names match the pattern *.jpgâSubversion should automatically set
   the svn:mime-type property on those files to image/jpeg. Or perhaps any
   files that match *.cpp should have svn:eol-style set to native, and
   svn:keywords set to Id. Automatic property support is perhaps the
   handiest property-related tool in the Subversion toolbox. See the
   section called âConfigâ for more about configuring that support.

File Portability

   Fortunately for Subversion users who routinely find themselves on
   different computers with different operating systems, Subversion's
   command-line program behaves almost identically on all those systems.
   If you know how to wield svn on one platform, you know how to wield it
   everywhere.

   However, the same is not always true of other general classes of
   software or of the actual files you keep in Subversion. For example, on
   a Windows machine, the definition of a âtext fileâ would be similar to
   that used on a Linux box, but with a key differenceâthe character
   sequences used to mark the ends of the lines of those files. There are
   other differences, too. Unix platforms have (and Subversion supports)
   symbolic links; Windows does not. Unix platforms use filesystem
   permission to determine executability; Windows uses filename
   extensions.

   Because Subversion is in no position to unite the whole world in common
   definitions and implementations of all of these things, the best it can
   do is to try to help make your life simpler when you need to work with
   your versioned files and directories on multiple computers and
   operating systems. This section describes some of the ways Subversion
   does this.

File Content Type

   Subversion joins the ranks of the many applications that recognize and
   make use of Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) content types.
   Besides being a general-purpose storage location for a file's content
   type, the value of the svn:mime-type file property determines some
   behavioral characteristics of Subversion itself.

   Identifying File Types

   Various programs on most modern operating systems make assumptions
   about the type and format of the contents of a file by the file's name,
   specifically its file extension. For example, files whose names end in
   .txt are generally assumed to be human-readable; that is, able to be
   understood by simple perusal rather than requiring complex processing
   to decipher. Files whose names end in .png, on the other hand, are
   assumed to be of the Portable Network Graphics typeânot human-readable
   at all, and sensible only when interpreted by software that understands
   the PNG format and can render the information in that format as a
   raster image.

   Unfortunately, some of those extensions have changed their meanings
   over time. When personal computers first appeared, a file named
   README.DOC would have almost certainly been a plain-text file, just
   like today's .txt files. But by the mid-1990s, you could almost bet
   that a file of that name would not be a plain-text file at all, but
   instead a Microsoft Word document in a proprietary, non-human-readable
   format. But this change didn't occur overnightâthere was certainly a
   period of confusion for computer users over what exactly they had in
   hand when they saw a .DOC file. ^[10]

   The popularity of computer networking cast still more doubt on the
   mapping between a file's name and its content. With information being
   served across networks and generated dynamically by server-side
   scripts, there was often no real file per se, and therefore no
   filename. Web servers, for example, needed some other way to tell
   browsers what they were downloading so that the browser could do
   something intelligent with that information, whether that was to
   display the data using a program registered to handle that datatype or
   to prompt the user for where on the client machine to store the
   downloaded data.

   Eventually, a standard emerged for, among other things, describing the
   contents of a data stream. In 1996, RFC 2045 was published. It was the
   first of five RFCs describing MIME. It describes the concept of media
   types and subtypes and recommends a syntax for the representation of
   those types. Today, MIME media typesâor âMIME typesââare used almost
   universally across email applications, web servers, and other software
   as the de facto mechanism for clearing up the file content confusion.

   For example, one of the benefits that Subversion typically provides is
   contextual, line-based merging of changes received from the server
   during an update into your working file. But for files containing
   nontextual data, there is often no concept of a âline.â So, for
   versioned files whose svn:mime-type property is set to a nontextual
   MIME type (generally, something that doesn't begin with text/, though
   there are exceptions), Subversion does not attempt to perform
   contextual merges during updates. Instead, any time you have locally
   modified a binary working copy file that is also being updated, your
   file is left untouched and Subversion creates two new files. One file
   has a .oldrev extension and contains the BASE revision of the file. The
   other file has a .newrev extension and contains the contents of the
   updated revision of the file. This behavior is really for the
   protection of the user against failed attempts at performing contextual
   merges on files that simply cannot be contextually merged.

Warning

   The svn:mime-type property, when set to a value that does not indicate
   textual file contents, can cause some unexpected behaviors with respect
   to other properties. For example, since the idea of line endings (and
   therefore, line-ending conversion) makes no sense when applied to
   nontextual files, Subversion will prevent you from setting the
   svn:eol-style property on such files. This is obvious when attempted on
   a single file targetâsvn propset will error out. But it might not be as
   clear if you perform a recursive property set, where Subversion will
   silently skip over files that it deems unsuitable for a given property.

   Beginning in Subversion 1.5, users can configure a new mime-types-file
   runtime configuration parameter, which identifies the location of a
   MIME types mapping file. Subversion will consult this mapping file to
   determine the MIME type of newly added and imported files.

   Also, if the svn:mime-type property is set, then the Subversion Apache
   module will use its value to populate the Content-type: HTTP header
   when responding to GET requests. This gives your web browser a crucial
   clue about how to display a file when you use it to peruse your
   Subversion repository's contents.

File Executability

   On many operating systems, the ability to execute a file as a command
   is governed by the presence of an execute permission bit. This bit
   usually defaults to being disabled, and must be explicitly enabled by
   the user for each file that needs it. But it would be a monumental
   hassle to have to remember exactly which files in a freshly checked-out
   working copy were supposed to have their executable bits toggled on,
   and then to have to do that toggling. So, Subversion provides the
   svn:executable property as a way to specify that the executable bit for
   the file on which that property is set should be enabled, and
   Subversion honors that request when populating working copies with such
   files.

   This property has no effect on filesystems that have no concept of an
   executable permission bit, such as FAT32 and NTFS. ^[11] Also, although
   it has no defined values, Subversion will force its value to * when
   setting this property. Finally, this property is valid only on files,
   not on directories.

End-of-Line Character Sequences

   Unless otherwise noted using a versioned file's svn:mime-type property,
   Subversion assumes the file contains human-readable data. Generally
   speaking, Subversion uses this knowledge only to determine whether
   contextual difference reports for that file are possible. Otherwise, to
   Subversion, bytes are bytes.

   This means that by default, Subversion doesn't pay any attention to the
   type of end-of-line (EOL) markers used in your files. Unfortunately,
   different operating systems have different conventions about which
   character sequences represent the end of a line of text in a file. For
   example, the usual line-ending token used by software on the Windows
   platform is a pair of ASCII control charactersâa carriage return (CR)
   followed by a line feed (LF). Unix software, however, just uses the LF
   character to denote the end of a line.

   Not all of the various tools on these operating systems understand
   files that contain line endings in a format that differs from the
   native line-ending style of the operating system on which they are
   running. So, typically, Unix programs treat the CR character present in
   Windows files as a regular character (usually rendered as ^M), and
   Windows programs combine all of the lines of a Unix file into one giant
   line because no carriage return-linefeed (or CRLF) character
   combination was found to denote the ends of the lines.

   This sensitivity to foreign EOL markers can be frustrating for folks
   who share a file across different operating systems. For example,
   consider a source code file, and developers that edit this file on both
   Windows and Unix systems. If all the developers always use tools that
   preserve the line-ending style of the file, no problems occur.

   But in practice, many common tools either fail to properly read a file
   with foreign EOL markers, or convert the file's line endings to the
   native style when the file is saved. If the former is true for a
   developer, he has to use an external conversion utility (such as
   dos2unix or its companion, unix2dos) to prepare the file for editing.
   The latter case requires no extra preparation. But both cases result in
   a file that differs from the original quite literally on every line!
   Prior to committing his changes, the user has two choices. Either he
   can use a conversion utility to restore the modified file to the same
   line-ending style that it was in before his edits were made, or he can
   simply commit the fileânew EOL markers and all.

   The result of scenarios like these include wasted time and unnecessary
   modifications to committed files. Wasted time is painful enough. But
   when commits change every line in a file, this complicates the job of
   determining which of those lines were changed in a nontrivial way.
   Where was that bug really fixed? On what line was a syntax error
   introduced?

   The solution to this problem is the svn:eol-style property. When this
   property is set to a valid value, Subversion uses it to determine what
   special processing to perform on the file so that the file's
   line-ending style isn't flip-flopping with every commit that comes from
   a different operating system. The valid values are:

   native
          This causes the file to contain the EOL markers that are native
          to the operating system on which Subversion was run. In other
          words, if a user on a Windows machine checks out a working copy
          that contains a file with an svn:eol-style property set to
          native, that file will contain CRLF EOL markers. A Unix user
          checking out a working copy that contains the same file will see
          LF EOL markers in his copy of the file.

          Note that Subversion will actually store the file in the
          repository using normalized LF EOL markers regardless of the
          operating system. This is basically transparent to the user,
          though.

   CRLF
          This causes the file to contain CRLF sequences for EOL markers,
          regardless of the operating system in use.

   LF
          This causes the file to contain LF characters for EOL markers,
          regardless of the operating system in use.

   CR
          This causes the file to contain CR characters for EOL markers,
          regardless of the operating system in use. This line-ending
          style is not very common.

Ignoring Unversioned Items

   In any given working copy, there is a good chance that alongside all
   those versioned files and directories are other files and directories
   that are neither versioned nor intended to be. Text editors litter
   directories with backup files. Software compilers generate
   intermediateâor even finalâfiles that you typically wouldn't bother to
   version. And users themselves drop various other files and directories
   wherever they see fit, often in version control working copies.

   It's ludicrous to expect Subversion working copies to be somehow
   impervious to this kind of clutter and impurity. In fact, Subversion
   counts it as a feature that its working copies are just typical
   directories, just like unversioned trees. But these not-to-be-versioned
   files and directories can cause some annoyance for Subversion users.
   For example, because the svn add and svn import commands act
   recursively by default and don't know which files in a given tree you
   do and don't wish to version, it's easy to accidentally add stuff to
   version control that you didn't mean to. And because svn status
   reports, by default, every item of interest in a working copyâincluding
   unversioned files and directoriesâits output can get quite noisy where
   many of these things exist.

   So Subversion provides two ways for telling it which files you would
   prefer that it simply disregard. One of the ways involves the use of
   Subversion's runtime configuration system (see the section called
   âRuntime Configuration Areaâ), and therefore applies to all the
   Subversion operations that make use of that runtime
   configurationâgenerally those performed on a particular computer or by
   a particular user of a computer. The other way makes use of
   Subversion's directory property support and is more tightly bound to
   the versioned tree itself, and therefore affects everyone who has a
   working copy of that tree. Both of the mechanisms use file patterns
   (strings of literal and special wildcard characters used to match
   against filenames) to decide which files to ignore.

   The Subversion runtime configuration system provides an option,
   global-ignores, whose value is a whitespace-delimited collection of
   file patterns. The Subversion client checks these patterns against the
   names of the files that are candidates for addition to version control,
   as well as to unversioned files that the svn status command notices. If
   any file's name matches one of the patterns, Subversion will basically
   act as if the file didn't exist at all. This is really useful for the
   kinds of files that you almost never want to version, such as editor
   backup files such as Emacs' *~ and .*~ files.

   File Patterns in Subversion

   File patterns (also called globs or shell wildcard patterns) are
   strings of characters that are intended to be matched against
   filenames, typically for the purpose of quickly selecting some subset
   of similar files from a larger grouping without having to explicitly
   name each file. The patterns contain two types of characters: regular
   characters, which are compared explicitly against potential matches,
   and special wildcard characters, which are interpreted differently for
   matching purposes.

   There are different types of file pattern syntaxes, but Subversion uses
   the one most commonly found in Unix systems implemented as the fnmatch
   system function. It supports the following wildcards, described here
   simply for your convenience:

   ?
          Matches any single character

   *
          Matches any string of characters, including the empty string

   [
          Begins a character class definition terminated by ], used for
          matching a subset of characters

   You can see this same pattern matching behavior at a Unix shell prompt.
   The following are some examples of patterns being used for various
   things:
$ ls   ### the book sources
appa-quickstart.xml             ch06-server-configuration.xml
appb-svn-for-cvs-users.xml      ch07-customizing-svn.xml

ch01-fundamental-concepts.xml   ch07-customizing-svn.xml
ch02-basic-usage.xml            ch08-embedding-svn.xml

ch05-repository-admin.xml
$ ls ch?0-*   ### the book chapters whose numbers end in zero
ch00-preface.xml  ch10-world-peace-thru-svn.xml
$ ls ch0[3578]-*   ### the book chapters that Mike is responsible for
ch03-advanced-topics.xml   ch07-customizing-svn.xml
ch05-repository-admin.xml  ch08-embedding-svn.xml
$

   File pattern matching is a bit more complex than what we've described
   here, but this basic usage level tends to suit the majority of
   Subversion users.

   When found on a versioned directory, the svn:ignore property is
   expected to contain a list of newline-delimited file patterns that
   Subversion should use to determine ignorable objects in that same
   directory. These patterns do not override those found in the
   global-ignores runtime configuration option, but are instead appended
   to that list. And it's worth noting again that, unlike the
   global-ignores option, the patterns found in the svn:ignore property
   apply only to the directory on which that property is set, and not to
   any of its subdirectories. The svn:ignore property is a good way to
   tell Subversion to ignore files that are likely to be present in every
   user's working copy of that directory, such as compiler output orâto
   use an example more appropriate to this bookâthe HTML, PDF, or
   PostScript files generated as the result of a conversion of some source
   DocBook XML files to a more legible output format.

Note

   Subversion's support for ignorable file patterns extends only to the
   one-time process of adding unversioned files and directories to version
   control. Once an object is under Subversion's control, the ignore
   pattern mechanisms no longer apply to it. In other words, don't expect
   Subversion to avoid committing changes you've made to a versioned file
   simply because that file's name matches an ignore patternâSubversion
   always notices all of its versioned objects.

   Ignore Patterns for CVS Users

   The Subversion svn:ignore property is very similar in syntax and
   function to the CVS .cvsignore file. In fact, if you are migrating a
   CVS working copy to Subversion, you can directly migrate the ignore
   patterns by using the .cvsignore file as input file to the svn propset
   command:
$ svn propset svn:ignore -F .cvsignore .
property 'svn:ignore' set on '.'
$

   There are, however, some differences in the ways that CVS and
   Subversion handle ignore patterns. The two systems use the ignore
   patterns at some different times, and there are slight discrepancies in
   what the ignore patterns apply to. Also, Subversion does not recognize
   the use of the ! pattern as a reset back to having no ignore patterns
   at all.

   The global list of ignore patterns tends to be more a matter of
   personal taste and ties more closely to a user's particular tool chain
   than to the details of any particular working copy's needs. So, the
   rest of this section will focus on the svn:ignore property and its
   uses.

   Say you have the following output from svn status:
$ svn status calc
 M     calc/button.c
?      calc/calculator
?      calc/data.c
?      calc/debug_log
?      calc/debug_log.1
?      calc/debug_log.2.gz
?      calc/debug_log.3.gz

   In this example, you have made some property modifications to button.c,
   but in your working copy, you also have some unversioned files: the
   latest calculator program that you've compiled from your source code, a
   source file named data.c, and a set of debugging output logfiles. Now,
   you know that your build system always results in the calculator
   program being generated. ^[12] And you know that your test suite always
   leaves those debugging logfiles lying around. These facts are true for
   all working copies of this project, not just your own. And you know
   that you aren't interested in seeing those things every time you run
   svn status, and you are pretty sure that nobody else is interested in
   them either. So you use svn propedit svn:ignore calc to add some ignore
   patterns to the calc directory. For example, you might add this as the
   new value of the svn:ignore property:
calculator
debug_log*

   After you've added this property, you will now have a local property
   modification on the calc directory. But notice what else is different
   about your svn status output:
$ svn status
 M     calc
 M     calc/button.c
?      calc/data.c

   Now, all that cruft is missing from the output! Your calculator
   compiled program and all those logfiles are still in your working copy;
   Subversion just isn't constantly reminding you that they are present
   and unversioned. And now with all the uninteresting noise removed from
   the display, you are left with more intriguing itemsâsuch as that
   source code file data.c that you probably forgot to add to version
   control.

   Of course, this less-verbose report of your working copy status isn't
   the only one available. If you actually want to see the ignored files
   as part of the status report, you can pass the --no-ignore option to
   Subversion:
$ svn status --no-ignore
 M     calc
 M     calc/button.c
I      calc/calculator
?      calc/data.c
I      calc/debug_log
I      calc/debug_log.1
I      calc/debug_log.2.gz
I      calc/debug_log.3.gz

   As mentioned earlier, the list of file patterns to ignore is also used
   by svn add and svn import. Both of these operations involve asking
   Subversion to begin managing some set of files and directories. Rather
   than force the user to pick and choose which files in a tree she wishes
   to start versioning, Subversion uses the ignore patternsâboth the
   global and the per-directory listsâto determine which files should not
   be swept into the version control system as part of a larger recursive
   addition or import operation. And here again, you can use the
   --no-ignore option to tell Subversion ignore its ignores list and
   operate on all the files and directories present.

Tip

   Even if svn:ignore is set, you may run into problems if you use shell
   wildcards in a command. Shell wildcards are expanded into an explicit
   list of targets before Subversion operates on them, so running svn
   SUBCOMMAND * is just like running svn SUBCOMMAND file1 file2 file3 â¦.
   In the case of the svn add command, this has an effect similar to
   passing the --no-ignore option. So instead of using a wildcard, use svn
   add --force . to do a bulk scheduling of unversioned things for
   addition. The explicit target will ensure that the current directory
   isn't overlooked because of being already under version control, and
   the --force option will cause Subversion to crawl through that
   directory, adding unversioned files while still honoring the svn:ignore
   property and global-ignores runtime configuration variable. Be sure to
   also provide the --depth files option to the svn add command if you
   don't want a fully recursive crawl for things to add.

Keyword Substitution

   Subversion has the ability to substitute keywordsâpieces of useful,
   dynamic information about a versioned fileâinto the contents of the
   file itself. Keywords generally provide information about the last
   modification made to the file. Because this information changes each
   time the file changes, and more importantly, just after the file
   changes, it is a hassle for any process except the version control
   system to keep the data completely up to date. Left to human authors,
   the information would inevitably grow stale.

   For example, say you have a document in which you would like to display
   the last date on which it was modified. You could burden every author
   of that document to, just before committing their changes, also tweak
   the part of the document that describes when it was last changed. But
   sooner or later, someone would forget to do that. Instead, simply ask
   Subversion to perform keyword substitution on the LastChangedDate
   keyword. You control where the keyword is inserted into your document
   by placing a keyword anchor at the desired location in the file. This
   anchor is just a string of text formatted as $KeywordName$.

   All keywords are case-sensitive where they appear as anchors in files:
   you must use the correct capitalization for the keyword to be expanded.
   You should consider the value of the svn:keywords property to be
   case-sensitive, tooâcertain keyword names will be recognized regardless
   of case, but this behavior is deprecated.

   Subversion defines the list of keywords available for substitution.
   That list contains the following five keywords, some of which have
   aliases that you can also use:

   Date
          This keyword describes the last time the file was known to have
          been changed in the repository, and is of the form $Date:
          2006-07-22 21:42:37 -0700 (Sat, 22 Jul 2006) $. It may also be
          specified as LastChangedDate. Unlike the Id keyword, which uses
          UTC, the Date keyword displays dates using the local time zone.

   Revision
          This keyword describes the last known revision in which this
          file changed in the repository, and looks something like
          $Revision: 144 $. It may also be specified as
          LastChangedRevision or Rev.

   Author
          This keyword describes the last known user to change this file
          in the repository, and looks something like $Author: harry $. It
          may also be specified as LastChangedBy.

   HeadURL
          This keyword describes the full URL to the latest version of the
          file in the repository, and looks something like $HeadURL:
          http://svn.collab.net/repos/trunk/README $. It may be
          abbreviated as URL.

   Id
          This keyword is a compressed combination of the other keywords.
          Its substitution looks something like $Id: calc.c 148 2006-07-28
          21:30:43Z sally $, and is interpreted to mean that the file
          calc.c was last changed in revision 148 on the evening of July
          28, 2006 by the user sally. The date displayed by this keyword
          is in UTC, unlike that of the Date keyword (which uses the local
          time zone).

   Several of the preceding descriptions use the phrase âlast knownâ or
   similar wording. Keep in mind that keyword expansion is a client-side
   operation, and your client âknowsâ only about changes that have
   occurred in the repository when you update your working copy to include
   those changes. If you never update your working copy, your keywords
   will never expand to different values even if those versioned files are
   being changed regularly in the repository.

   Simply adding keyword anchor text to your file does nothing special.
   Subversion will never attempt to perform textual substitutions on your
   file contents unless explicitly asked to do so. After all, you might be
   writing a document ^[13] about how to use keywords, and you don't want
   Subversion to substitute your beautiful examples of unsubstituted
   keyword anchors!

   To tell Subversion whether to substitute keywords on a particular file,
   we again turn to the property-related subcommands. The svn:keywords
   property, when set on a versioned file, controls which keywords will be
   substituted on that file. The value is a space-delimited list of
   keyword names or aliases.

   For example, say you have a versioned file named weather.txt that looks
   like this:
Here is the latest report from the front lines.
$LastChangedDate$
$Rev$
Cumulus clouds are appearing more frequently as summer approaches.

   With no svn:keywords property set on that file, Subversion will do
   nothing special. Now, let's enable substitution of the LastChangedDate
   keyword.
$ svn propset svn:keywords "Date Author" weather.txt
property 'svn:keywords' set on 'weather.txt'
$

   Now you have made a local property modification on the weather.txt
   file. You will see no changes to the file's contents (unless you made
   some of your own prior to setting the property). Notice that the file
   contained a keyword anchor for the Rev keyword, yet we did not include
   that keyword in the property value we set. Subversion will happily
   ignore requests to substitute keywords that are not present in the file
   and will not substitute keywords that are not present in the
   svn:keywords property value.

   Immediately after you commit this property change, Subversion will
   update your working file with the new substitute text. Instead of
   seeing your keyword anchor $LastChangedDate$, you'll see its
   substituted result. That result also contains the name of the keyword
   and continues to be delimited by the dollar sign ($) characters. And as
   we predicted, the Rev keyword was not substituted because we didn't ask
   for it to be.

   Note also that we set the svn:keywords property to Date Author, yet the
   keyword anchor used the alias $LastChangedDate$ and still expanded
   correctly:
Here is the latest report from the front lines.
$LastChangedDate: 2006-07-22 21:42:37 -0700 (Sat, 22 Jul 2006) $
$Rev$
Cumulus clouds are appearing more frequently as summer approaches.

   If someone else now commits a change to weather.txt, your copy of that
   file will continue to display the same substituted keyword value as
   beforeâuntil you update your working copy. At that time, the keywords
   in your weather.txt file will be resubstituted with information that
   reflects the most recent known commit to that file.

   Where's $GlobalRev$?

   New users are often confused by how the $Rev$ keyword works. Since the
   repository has a single, globally increasing revision number, many
   people assume that it is this number that is reflected by the $Rev$
   keyword's value. But $Rev$ expands to show the last revision in which
   the file changed, not the last revision to which it was updated.
   Understanding this clears the confusion, but frustration often
   remainsâwithout the support of a Subversion keyword to do so, how can
   you automatically get the global revision number into your files?

   To do this, you need external processing. Subversion ships with a tool
   called svnversion, which was designed for just this purpose. It crawls
   your working copy and generates as output the revision(s) it finds. You
   can use this program, plus some additional tooling, to embed that
   revision information into your files. For more information on
   svnversion, see the section called âsvnversionâ.

   Subversion 1.2 introduced a new variant of the keyword syntax, which
   brought additional, usefulâthough perhaps atypicalâfunctionality. You
   can now tell Subversion to maintain a fixed length (in terms of the
   number of bytes consumed) for the substituted keyword. By using a
   double colon (::) after the keyword name, followed by a number of space
   characters, you define that fixed width. When Subversion goes to
   substitute your keyword for the keyword and its value, it will
   essentially replace only those space characters, leaving the overall
   width of the keyword field unchanged. If the substituted value is
   shorter than the defined field width, there will be extra padding
   characters (spaces) at the end of the substituted field; if it is too
   long, it is truncated with a special hash (#) character just before the
   final dollar sign terminator.

   For example, say you have a document in which you have some section of
   tabular data reflecting the document's Subversion keywords. Using the
   original Subversion keyword substitution syntax, your file might look
   something like:
$Rev$:     Revision of last commit
$Author$:  Author of last commit
$Date$:    Date of last commit

   Now, that looks nice and tabular at the start of things. But when you
   then commit that file (with keyword substitution enabled, of course),
   you see:
$Rev: 12 $:     Revision of last commit
$Author: harry $:  Author of last commit
$Date: 2006-03-15 02:33:03 -0500 (Wed, 15 Mar 2006) $:    Date of last commit

   The result is not so beautiful. And you might be tempted to then adjust
   the file after the substitution so that it again looks tabular. But
   that holds only as long as the keyword values are the same width. If
   the last committed revision rolls into a new place value (say, from 99
   to 100), or if another person with a longer username commits the file,
   stuff gets all crooked again. However, if you are using Subversion 1.2
   or later, you can use the new fixed-length keyword syntax and define
   some field widths that seem sane, so your file might look like this:
$Rev::               $:  Revision of last commit
$Author::            $:  Author of last commit
$Date::              $:  Date of last commit

   You commit this change to your file. This time, Subversion notices the
   new fixed-length keyword syntax and maintains the width of the fields
   as defined by the padding you placed between the double colon and the
   trailing dollar sign. After substitution, the width of the fields is
   completely unchangedâthe short values for Rev and Author are padded
   with spaces, and the long Date field is truncated by a hash character:
$Rev:: 13            $:  Revision of last commit
$Author:: harry      $:  Author of last commit
$Date:: 2006-03-15 0#$:  Date of last commit

   The use of fixed-length keywords is especially handy when performing
   substitutions into complex file formats that themselves use
   fixed-length fields for data, or for which the stored size of a given
   data field is overbearingly difficult to modify from outside the
   format's native application (such as for Microsoft Office documents).

Warning

   Be aware that because the width of a keyword field is measured in
   bytes, the potential for corruption of multibyte values exists. For
   example, a username that contains some multibyte UTF-8 characters might
   suffer truncation in the middle of the string of bytes that make up one
   of those characters. The result will be a mere truncation when viewed
   at the byte level, but will likely appear as a string with an incorrect
   or garbled final character when viewed as UTF-8 text. It is conceivable
   that certain applications, when asked to load the file, would notice
   the broken UTF-8 text and deem the entire file corrupt, refusing to
   operate on the file altogether. So, when limiting keywords to a fixed
   size, choose a size that allows for this type of byte-wise expansion.

Sparse Directories

   By default, most Subversion operations on directories act in a
   recursive manner. For example, svn checkout creates a working copy with
   every file and directory in the specified area of the repository,
   descending recursively through the repository tree until the entire
   structure is copied to your local disk. Subversion 1.5 introduces a
   feature called sparse directories (or shallow checkouts) that allows
   you to easily check out a working copyâor a portion of a working
   copyâmore shallowly than full recursion, with the freedom to bring in
   previously ignored files and subdirectories at a later time.

   For example, say we have a repository with a tree of files and
   directories with names of the members of a human family with pets.
   (It's an odd example, to be sure, but bear with us.) A regular svn
   checkout operation will give us a working copy of the whole tree:
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom
A    mom/son
A    mom/son/grandson
A    mom/daughter
A    mom/daughter/granddaughter1
A    mom/daughter/granddaughter1/bunny1.txt
A    mom/daughter/granddaughter1/bunny2.txt
A    mom/daughter/granddaughter2
A    mom/daughter/fishie.txt
A    mom/kitty1.txt
A    mom/doggie1.txt
Checked out revision 1.
$

   Now, let's check out the same tree again, but this time we'll ask
   Subversion to give us only the topmost directory with none of its
   children at all:
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom-empty --depth empty
Checked out revision 1
$

   Notice that we added to our original svn checkout command line a new
   --depth option. This option is present on many of Subversion's
   subcommands and is similar to the --non-recursive (-N) and --recursive
   (-R) options. In fact, it combines, improves upon, supercedes, and
   ultimately obsoletes these two older options. For starters, it expands
   the supported degrees of depth specification available to users, adding
   some previously unsupported (or inconsistently supported) depths. Here
   are the depth values that you can request for a given Subversion
   operation:

   --depth empty
          Include only the immediate target of the operation, not any of
          its file or directory children.

   --depth files
          Include the immediate target of the operation and any of its
          immediate file children.

   --depth immediates
          Include the immediate target of the operation and any of its
          immediate file or directory children. The directory children
          will themselves be empty.

   --depth infinity
          Include the immediate target, its file and directory children,
          its children's children, and so on to full recursion.

   Of course, merely combining two existing options into one hardly
   constitutes a new feature worthy of a whole section in our book.
   Fortunately, there is more to this story. This idea of depth extends
   not just to the operations you perform with your Subversion client, but
   also as a description of a working copy citizen's ambient depth, which
   is the depth persistently recorded by the working copy for that item.
   Its key strength is this very persistenceâthe fact that it is sticky.
   The working copy remembers the depth you've selected for each item in
   it until you later change that depth selection; by default, Subversion
   commands operate on the working copy citizens present, regardless of
   their selected depth settings.

Tip

   You can check the recorded ambient depth of a working copy using the
   svn info command. If the ambient depth is anything other than infinite
   recursion, svn info will display a line describing that depth value:
$ svn info mom-immediates | grep '^Depth:'
Depth: immediates
$

   Our previous examples demonstrated checkouts of infinite depth (the
   default for svn checkout) and empty depth. Let's look now at examples
   of the other depth values:
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom-files --depth files
A    mom-files/kitty1.txt
A    mom-files/doggie1.txt
Checked out revision 1.
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom-immediates --depth immediates
A    mom-immediates/son
A    mom-immediates/daughter
A    mom-immediates/kitty1.txt
A    mom-immediates/doggie1.txt
Checked out revision 1.
$

   As described, each of these depths is something more than only the
   target, but something less than full recursion.

   We've used svn checkout as an example here, but you'll find the --depth
   option present on many other Subversion commands, too. In those other
   commands, depth specification is a way to limit the scope of an
   operation to some depth, much like the way the older --non-recursive
   (-N) and --recursive (-R) options behave. This means that when
   operating on a working copy of some depth, while requesting an
   operation of a shallower depth, the operation is limited to that
   shallower depth. In fact, we can make an even more general statement:
   given a working copy of any arbitraryâeven mixedâambient depth, and a
   Subversion command with some requested operational depth, the command
   will maintain the ambient depth of the working copy members while still
   limiting the scope of the operation to the requested (or default)
   operational depth.

   In addition to the --depth option, the svn update and svn switch
   subcommands also accept a second depth-related option: --set-depth. It
   is with this option that you can change the sticky depth of a working
   copy item. Watch what happens as we take our empty-depth checkout and
   gradually telescope it deeper using svn update --set-depth NEW-DEPTH
   TARGET:
$ svn update --set-depth files mom-empty
A    mom-empty/kittie1.txt
A    mom-empty/doggie1.txt
Updated to revision 1.
$ svn update --set-depth immediates mom-empty
A    mom-empty/son
A    mom-empty/daughter
Updated to revision 1.
$ svn update --set-depth infinity mom-empty
A    mom-empty/son/grandson
A    mom-empty/daughter/granddaughter1
A    mom-empty/daughter/granddaughter1/bunny1.txt
A    mom-empty/daughter/granddaughter1/bunny2.txt
A    mom-empty/daughter/granddaughter2
A    mom-empty/daughter/fishie1.txt
Updated to revision 1.
$

   As we gradually increased our depth selection, the repository gave us
   more pieces of our tree.

   In our example, we operated only on the root of our working copy,
   changing its ambient depth value. But we can independently change the
   ambient depth value of any subdirectory inside the working copy, too.
   Careful use of this ability allows us to flesh out only certain
   portions of the working copy tree, leaving other portions absent
   altogether (hence the âsparseâ bit of the feature's name). Here's an
   example of how we might build out a portion of one branch of our
   family's tree, enable full recursion on another branch, and keep still
   other pieces pruned (absent from disk).
$ rm -rf mom-empty
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom-empty --depth empty
Checked out revision 1.
$ svn update --set-depth empty mom-empty/son
A    mom-empty/son
Updated to revision 1.
$ svn update --set-depth empty mom-empty/daughter
A    mom-empty/daughter

$ svn update --set-depth infinity mom-empty/daughter/granddaughter1
A    mom-empty/daughter/granddaughter1
A    mom-empty/daughter/granddaughter1/bunny1.txt
A    mom-empty/daughter/granddaughter1/bunny2.txt
Updated to revision 1.
$

   Fortunately, having a complex collection of ambient depths in a single
   working copy doesn't complicate the way you interact with that working
   copy. You can still make, revert, display, and commit local
   modifications in your working copy without providing any new options
   (including --depth and --set-depth) to the relevant subcommands. Even
   svn update works as it does elsewhere when no specific depth is
   providedâit updates the working copy targets that are present while
   honoring their sticky depths.

   You might at this point be wondering, âSo what? When would I use this?â
   One scenario where this feature finds utility is tied to a particular
   repository layout, specifically where you have many related or
   codependent projects or software modules living as siblings in a single
   repository location (trunk/project1, trunk/project2, trunk/project3,
   etc.). In such scenarios, it might be the case that you personally care
   about only a handful of those projectsâmaybe some primary project and a
   few other modules on which it depends. You can check out individual
   working copies of all of these things, but those working copies are
   disjoint and, as a result, it can be cumbersome to perform operations
   across several or all of them at the same time. The alternative is to
   use the sparse directories feature, building out a single working copy
   that contains only the modules you care about. You'd start with an
   empty-depth checkout of the common parent directory of the projects,
   and then update with infinite depth only the items you wish to have,
   like we demonstrated in the previous example. Think of it like an
   opt-in system for working copy citizens.

   Subversion 1.5's implementation of shallow checkouts is good but does
   not support a couple of interesting behaviors. First, you cannot
   de-telescope a working copy item. Running svn update --set-depth empty
   in an infinite-depth working copy will not have the effect of
   discarding everything but the topmost directoryâit will simply error
   out. Second, there is no depth value to indicate that you wish an item
   to be explicitly excluded. You have to do implicit exclusion of an item
   by including everything else.

Locking

   Subversion's copy-modify-merge version control model lives and dies on
   its data merging algorithmsâspecifically on how well those algorithms
   perform when trying to resolve conflicts caused by multiple users
   modifying the same file concurrently. Subversion itself provides only
   one such algorithm: a three-way differencing algorithm that is smart
   enough to handle data at a granularity of a single line of text.
   Subversion also allows you to supplement its content merge processing
   with external differencing utilities (as described in the section
   called âExternal diff3â), some of which may do an even better job,
   perhaps providing granularity of a word or a single character of text.
   But common among those algorithms is that they generally work only on
   text files. The landscape starts to look pretty grim when you start
   talking about content merges of nontextual file formats. And when you
   can't find a tool that can handle that type of merging, you begin to
   run into problems with the copy-modify-merge model.

   Let's look at a real-life example of where this model runs aground.
   Harry and Sally are both graphic designers working on the same project,
   a bit of marketing collateral for an automobile mechanic. Central to
   the design of a particular poster is an image of a car in need of some
   bodywork, stored in a file using the PNG image format. The poster's
   layout is almost finished, and both Harry and Sally are pleased with
   the particular photo they chose for their damaged carâa baby blue 1967
   Ford Mustang with an unfortunate bit of crumpling on the left front
   fender.

   Now, as is common in graphic design work, there's a change in plans,
   which causes the car's color to be a concern. So Sally updates her
   working copy to HEAD, fires up her photo-editing software, and sets
   about tweaking the image so that the car is now cherry red. Meanwhile,
   Harry, feeling particularly inspired that day, decides that the image
   would have greater impact if the car also appears to have suffered
   greater impact. He, too, updates to HEAD, and then draws some cracks on
   the vehicle's windshield. He manages to finish his work before Sally
   finishes hers, and after admiring the fruits of his undeniable talent,
   he commits the modified image. Shortly thereafter, Sally is finished
   with the car's new finish and tries to commit her changes. But, as
   expected, Subversion fails the commit, informing Sally that her version
   of the image is now out of date.

   Here's where the difficulty sets in. If Harry and Sally were making
   changes to a text file, Sally would simply update her working copy,
   receiving Harry's changes in the process. In the worst possible case,
   they would have modified the same region of the file, and Sally would
   have to work out by hand the proper resolution to the conflict. But
   these aren't text filesâthey are binary images. And while it's a simple
   matter to describe what one would expect the results of this content
   merge to be, there is precious little chance that any software exists
   that is smart enough to examine the common baseline image that each of
   these graphic artists worked against, the changes that Harry made, and
   the changes that Sally made, and then spit out an image of a busted-up
   red Mustang with a cracked windshield!

   Of course, things would have gone more smoothly if Harry and Sally had
   serialized their modifications to the imageâif, say, Harry had waited
   to draw his windshield cracks on Sally's now-red car, or if Sally had
   tweaked the color of a car whose windshield was already cracked. As is
   discussed in the section called âThe Copy-Modify-Merge Solutionâ, most
   of these types of problems go away entirely where perfect communication
   between Harry and Sally exists. ^[14] But as one's version control
   system is, in fact, one form of communication, it follows that having
   that software facilitate the serialization of nonparallelizable editing
   efforts is no bad thing. This is where Subversion's implementation of
   the lock-modify-unlock model steps into the spotlight. This is where we
   talk about Subversion's locking feature, which is similar to the
   âreserved checkoutsâ mechanisms of other version control systems.

   Subversion's locking feature exists ultimately to minimize wasted time
   and effort. By allowing a user to programmatically claim the exclusive
   right to change a file in the repository, that user can be reasonably
   confident that any energy he invests on unmergeable changes won't be
   wastedâhis commit of those changes will succeed. Also, because
   Subversion communicates to other users that serialization is in effect
   for a particular versioned object, those users can reasonably expect
   that the object is about to be changed by someone else. They, too, can
   then avoid wasting their time and energy on unmergeable changes that
   won't be committable due to eventual out-of-dateness.

   When referring to Subversion's locking feature, one is actually talking
   about a fairly diverse collection of behaviors, which include the
   ability to lock a versioned file ^[15] (claiming the exclusive right to
   modify the file), to unlock that file (yielding that exclusive right to
   modify), to see reports about which files are locked and by whom, to
   annotate files for which locking before editing is strongly advised,
   and so on. In this section, we'll cover all of these facets of the
   larger locking feature.

   The Three Meanings of âLockâ

   In this section, and almost everywhere in this book, the words âlockâ
   and âlockingâ describe a mechanism for mutual exclusion between users
   to avoid clashing commits. Unfortunately, there are two other sorts of
   âlockâ with which Subversion, and therefore this book, sometimes needs
   to be concerned.

   The second is working copy locks, used internally by Subversion to
   prevent clashes between multiple Subversion clients operating on the
   same working copy. This is the sort of lock indicated by an L in the
   third column of svn status output, and removed by the svn cleanup
   command, as described in the section called âSometimes You Just Need to
   Clean Upâ.

   Third, there are database locks, used internally by the Berkeley DB
   backend to prevent clashes between multiple programs trying to access
   the database. This is the sort of lock whose unwanted persistence after
   an error can cause a repository to be âwedged,â as described in the
   section called âBerkeley DB Recoveryâ.

   You can generally forget about these other kinds of locks until
   something goes wrong that requires you to care about them. In this
   book, âlockâ means the first sort unless the contrary is either clear
   from context or explicitly stated.

Creating Locks

   In the Subversion repository, a lock is a piece of metadata that grants
   exclusive access to one user to change a file. This user is said to be
   the lock owner. Each lock also has a unique identifier, typically a
   long string of characters, known as the lock token. The repository
   manages locks, ultimately handling their creation, enforcement, and
   removal. If any commit transaction attempts to modify or delete a
   locked file (or delete one of the parent directories of the file), the
   repository will demand two pieces of informationâthat the client
   performing the commit be authenticated as the lock owner, and that the
   lock token has been provided as part of the commit process as a form of
   proof that the client knows which lock it is using.

   To demonstrate lock creation, let's refer back to our example of
   multiple graphic designers working on the same binary image files.
   Harry has decided to change a JPEG image. To prevent other people from
   committing changes to the file while he is modifying it (as well as
   alerting them that he is about to change it), he locks the file in the
   repository using the svn lock command.
$ svn lock banana.jpg -m "Editing file for tomorrow's release."
'banana.jpg' locked by user 'harry'.
$

   The preceding example demonstrates a number of new things. First,
   notice that Harry passed the --message (-m) option to svn lock. Similar
   to svn commit, the svn lock command can take commentsâvia either
   --message (-m) or --file (-F)âto describe the reason for locking the
   file. Unlike svn commit, however, svn lock will not demand a message by
   launching your preferred text editor. Lock comments are optional, but
   still recommended to aid communication.

   Second, the lock attempt succeeded. This means that the file wasn't
   already locked, and that Harry had the latest version of the file. If
   Harry's working copy of the file had been out of date, the repository
   would have rejected the request, forcing Harry to svn update and
   reattempt the locking command. The locking command would also have
   failed if the file had already been locked by someone else.

   As you can see, the svn lock command prints confirmation of the
   successful lock. At this point, the fact that the file is locked
   becomes apparent in the output of the svn status and svn info reporting
   subcommands.
$ svn status

$

   The fact that the svn info command, which does not contact the
   repository when run against working copy paths, can display the lock
   token reveals an important piece of information about those tokens:
   they are cached in the working copy. The presence of the lock token is
   critical. It gives the working copy authorization to make use of the
   lock later on. Also, the svn status command shows a K next to the file
   (short for locKed), indicating that the lock token is present.

   Regarding Lock Tokens

   A lock token isn't an authentication token, so much as an authorization
   token. The token isn't a protected secret. In fact, a lock's unique
   token is discoverable by anyone who runs svn info URL. A lock token is
   special only when it lives inside a working copy. It's proof that the
   lock was created in that particular working copy, and not somewhere
   else by some other client. Merely authenticating as the lock owner
   isn't enough to prevent accidents.

   For example, suppose you lock a file using a computer at your office,
   but leave work for the day before you finish your changes to that file.
   It should not be possible to accidentally commit changes to that same
   file from your home computer later that evening simply because you've
   authenticated as the lock's owner. In other words, the lock token
   prevents one piece of Subversion-related software from undermining the
   work of another. (In our example, if you really need to change the file
   from an alternative working copy, you would need to break the lock and
   relock the file.)

   Now that Harry has locked banana.jpg, Sally is unable to change or
   delete that file:
$ svn delete banana.jpg
D         banana.jpg
$ svn commit -m "Delete useless file."
Deleting       banana.jpg
svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: Server sent unexpected return value (423 Locked) in response to DELETE\
 request for '/repos/project/!svn/wrk/64bad3a9-96f9-0310-818a-df4224ddc35d/\
banana.jpg'
$

   But Harry, after touching up the banana's shade of yellow, is able to
   commit his changes to the file. That's because he authenticates as the
   lock owner and also because his working copy holds the correct lock
   token:
$ svn status
M    K banana.jpg
$ svn commit -m "Make banana more yellow"
Sending        banana.jpg
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 2201.
$ svn status
$

   Notice that after the commit is finished, svn status shows that the
   lock token is no longer present in the working copy. This is the
   standard behavior of svn commitâit searches the working copy (or list
   of targets, if you provide such a list) for local modifications and
   sends all the lock tokens it encounters during this walk to the server
   as part of the commit transaction. After the commit completes
   successfully, all of the repository locks that were mentioned are
   releasedâeven on files that weren't committed. This is meant to
   discourage users from being sloppy about locking or from holding locks
   for too long. If Harry haphazardly locks 30 files in a directory named
   images because he's unsure of which files he needs to change, yet
   changes only four of those files, when he runs svn commit images, the
   process will still release all 30 locks.

   This behavior of automatically releasing locks can be overridden with
   the --no-unlock option to svn commit. This is best used for those times
   when you want to commit changes, but still plan to make more changes
   and thus need to retain existing locks. You can also make this your
   default behavior by setting the no-unlock runtime configuration option
   (see the section called âRuntime Configuration Areaâ).

   Of course, locking a file doesn't oblige one to commit a change to it.
   The lock can be released at any time with a simple svn unlock command:
$ svn unlock banana.c
'banana.c' unlocked.

Discovering Locks

   When a commit fails due to someone else's locks, it's fairly easy to
   learn about them. The easiest way is to run svn status --show-updates:
$ svn status -u
M              23   bar.c
M    O         32   raisin.jpg
       *       72   foo.h
Status against revision:     105
$

   In this example, Sally can see not only that her copy of foo.h is out
   of date, but also that one of the two modified files she plans to
   commit is locked in the repository. The O symbol stands for âOther,â
   meaning that a lock exists on the file and was created by somebody
   else. If she were to attempt a commit, the lock on raisin.jpg would
   prevent it. Sally is left wondering who made the lock, when, and why.
   Once again, svn info has the answers:
$ svn info http://svn.example.com/repos/project/raisin.jpg
Path: raisin.jpg
Name: raisin.jpg
URL: http://svn.example.com/repos/project/raisin.jpg
Repository UUID: edb2f264-5ef2-0310-a47a-87b0ce17a8ec

$

   Just as you can use svn info to examine objects in the working copy,
   you can also use it to examine objects in the repository. If the main
   argument to svn info is a working copy path, then all of the working
   copy's cached information is displayed; any mention of a lock means
   that the working copy is holding a lock token (if a file is locked by
   another user or in another working copy, svn info on a working copy
   path will show no lock information at all). If the main argument to svn
   info is a URL, the information reflects the latest version of an object
   in the repository, and any mention of a lock describes the current lock
   on the object.

   So in this particular example, Sally can see that Harry locked the file
   on February 16 to âmake a quick tweak.â It being June, she suspects
   that he probably forgot all about the lock. She might phone Harry to
   complain and ask him to release the lock. If he's unavailable, she
   might try to forcibly break the lock herself or ask an administrator to
   do so.

Breaking and Stealing Locks

   A repository lock isn't sacredâin Subversion's default configuration
   state, locks can be released not only by the person who created them,
   but by anyone. When somebody other than the original lock creator
   destroys a lock, we refer to this as breaking the lock.

   From the administrator's chair, it's simple to break locks. The svnlook
   and svnadmin programs have the ability to display and remove locks
   directly from the repository. (For more information about these tools,
   see the section called âAn Administrator's Toolkitâ.)

Removed lock on '/project/raisin.jpg'.
$

   The more interesting option is to allow users to break each other's
   locks over the network. To do this, Sally simply needs to pass the
   --force to the svn unlock command:
$ svn status -u
M              23   bar.c
M    O         32   raisin.jpg
       *       72   foo.h
Status against revision:     105
$ svn unlock raisin.jpg
svn: 'raisin.jpg' is not locked in this working copy
$ svn info raisin.jpg | grep URL
URL: http://svn.example.com/repos/project/raisin.jpg
$ svn unlock http://svn.example.com/repos/project/raisin.jpg
svn: Unlock request failed: 403 Forbidden (http://svn.example.com)
$ svn unlock --force http://svn.example.com/repos/project/raisin.jpg
'raisin.jpg' unlocked.
$

   Now, Sally's initial attempt to unlock failed because she ran svn
   unlock directly on her working copy of the file, and no lock token was
   present. To remove the lock directly from the repository, she needs to
   pass a URL to svn unlock. Her first attempt to unlock the URL fails,
   because she can't authenticate as the lock owner (nor does she have the
   lock token). But when she passes --force, the authentication and
   authorization requirements are ignored, and the remote lock is broken.

   Simply breaking a lock may not be enough. In the running example, Sally
   may not only want to break Harry's long-forgotten lock, but relock the
   file for her own use. She can accomplish this by using svn unlock with
   --force and then svn lock back-to-back, but there's a small chance that
   somebody else might lock the file between the two commands. The simpler
   thing to do is to steal the lock, which involves breaking and relocking
   the file all in one atomic step. To do this, Sally passes the --force
   option to svn lock:
$ svn lock raisin.jpg
svn: Lock request failed: 423 Locked (http://svn.example.com)
$ svn lock --force raisin.jpg
'raisin.jpg' locked by user 'sally'.
$

   In any case, whether the lock is broken or stolen, Harry may be in for
   a surprise. Harry's working copy still contains the original lock
   token, but that lock no longer exists. The lock token is said to be
   defunct. The lock represented by the lock token has either been broken
   (no longer in the repository) or stolen (replaced with a different
   lock). Either way, Harry can see this by asking svn status to contact
   the repository:
$ svn status
     K raisin.jpg
$ svn status -u
     B         32   raisin.jpg
$ svn update
  B  raisin.jpg
$ svn status
$

   If the repository lock was broken, then svn status --show-updates
   displays a B (Broken) symbol next to the file. If a new lock exists in
   place of the old one, then a T (sTolen) symbol is shown. Finally, svn
   update notices any defunct lock tokens and removes them from the
   working copy.

   Locking Policies

   Different systems have different notions of how strict a lock should
   be. Some folks argue that locks must be strictly enforced at all costs,
   releasable only by the original creator or administrator. They argue
   that if anyone can break a lock, chaos runs rampant and the whole point
   of locking is defeated. The other side argues that locks are first and
   foremost a communication tool. If users are constantly breaking each
   other's locks, it represents a cultural failure within the team and the
   problem falls outside the scope of software enforcement.

   Subversion defaults to the âsofterâ approach, but still allows
   administrators to create stricter enforcement policies through the use
   of hook scripts. In particular, the pre-lock and pre-unlock hooks allow
   administrators to decide when lock creation and lock releases are
   allowed to happen. Depending on whether a lock already exists, these
   two hooks can decide whether to allow a certain user to break or steal
   a lock. The post-lock and post-unlock hooks are also available, and can
   be used to send email after locking actions. To learn more about
   repository hooks, see the section called âImplementing Repository
   Hooksâ.

Lock Communication

   We've seen how svn lock and svn unlock can be used to create, release,
   break, and steal locks. This satisfies the goal of serializing commit
   access to a file. But what about the larger problem of preventing
   wasted time?

   For example, suppose Harry locks an image file and then begins editing
   it. Meanwhile, miles away, Sally wants to do the same thing. She
   doesn't think to run svn status --show-updates, so she has no idea that
   Harry has already locked the file. She spends hours editing the file,
   and when she tries to commit her change, she discovers that either the
   file is locked or that she's out of date. Regardless, her changes
   aren't mergeable with Harry's. One of these two people has to throw
   away his or her work, and a lot of time has been wasted.

   Subversion's solution to this problem is to provide a mechanism to
   remind users that a file ought to be locked before the editing begins.
   The mechanism is a special property: svn:needs-lock. If that property
   is attached to a file (regardless of its value, which is irrelevant),
   Subversion will try to use filesystem-level permissions to make the
   file read-onlyâunless, of course, the user has explicitly locked the
   file. When a lock token is present (as a result of using svn lock), the
   file becomes read/write. When the lock is released, the file becomes
   read-only again.

   The theory, then, is that if the image file has this property attached,
   Sally would immediately notice something is strange when she opens the
   file for editing: many applications alert users immediately when a
   read-only file is opened for editing, and nearly all would prevent her
   from saving changes to the file. This reminds her to lock the file
   before editing, whereby she discovers the preexisting lock:
$ /usr/local/bin/gimp raisin.jpg
gimp: error: file is read-only!
$ ls -l raisin.jpg

Tip

   Users and administrators alike are encouraged to attach the
   svn:needs-lock property to any file that cannot be contextually merged.
   This is the primary technique for encouraging good locking habits and
   preventing wasted effort.

   Note that this property is a communication tool that works
   independently from the locking system. In other words, any file can be
   locked, whether or not this property is present. And conversely, the
   presence of this property doesn't make the repository require a lock
   when committing.

   Unfortunately, the system isn't flawless. It's possible that even when
   a file has the property, the read-only reminder won't always work.
   Sometimes applications misbehave and âhijackâ the read-only file,
   silently allowing users to edit and save the file anyway. There's not
   much that Subversion can do in this situationâat the end of the day,
   there's simply no substitution for good interpersonal communication.

Externals Definitions

   Sometimes it is useful to construct a working copy that is made out of
   a number of different checkouts. For example, you may want different
   subdirectories to come from different locations in a repository or
   perhaps from different repositories altogether. You could certainly set
   up such a scenario by handâusing svn checkout to create the sort of
   nested working copy structure you are trying to achieve. But if this
   layout is important for everyone who uses your repository, every other
   user will need to perform the same checkout operations that you did.

   Fortunately, Subversion provides support for externals definitions. An
   externals definition is a mapping of a local directory to the URLâand
   ideally a particular revisionâof a versioned directory. In Subversion,
   you declare externals definitions in groups using the svn:externals
   property. You can create or modify this property using svn propset or
   svn propedit (see the section called âManipulating Propertiesâ). It can
   be set on any versioned directory, and its value describes both the
   external repository location and the client-side directory to which
   that location should be checked out.

   The convenience of the svn:externals property is that once it is set on
   a versioned directory, everyone who checks out a working copy with that
   directory also gets the benefit of the externals definition. In other
   words, once one person has made the effort to define the nested working
   copy structure, no one else has to botherâSubversion will, after
   checking out the original working copy, automatically also check out
   the external working copies.

Warning

   The relative target subdirectories of externals definitions must not
   already exist on your or other users' systemsâSubversion will create
   them when it checks out the external working copy.

   You also get in the externals definition design all the regular
   benefits of Subversion properties. The definitions are versioned. If
   you need to change an externals definition, you can do so using the
   regular property modification subcommands. When you commit a change to
   the svn:externals property, Subversion will synchronize the checked-out
   items against the changed externals definition when you next run svn
   update. The same thing will happen when others update their working
   copies and receive your changes to the externals definition.

Tip

   Because the svn:externals property has a multiline value, we strongly
   recommend that you use svn propedit instead of svn propset.

   Subversion releases prior to 1.5 honor an externals definition format
   that is a multiline table of subdirectories (relative to the versioned
   directory on which the property is set), optional revision flags, and
   fully qualified, absolute Subversion repository URLs. An example of
   this might looks as follows:
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
third-party/sounds             http://svn.example.com/repos/sounds
third-party/skins -r148        http://svn.example.com/skinproj
third-party/skins/toolkit -r21 http://svn.example.com/skin-maker

   When someone checks out a working copy of the calc directory referred
   to in the previous example, Subversion also continues to check out the
   items found in its externals definition.
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/calc
A  calc
A  calc/Makefile
A  calc/integer.c
A  calc/button.c
Checked out revision 148.

â¦
A  calc/third-party/sounds/bang.ogg
A  calc/third-party/sounds/twang.ogg
Checked out revision 14.

Fetching external item into calc/third-party/skins
â¦

   As of Subversion 1.5, though, a new format of the svn:externals
   property is supported. Externals definitions are still multiline, but
   the order and format of the various pieces of information have changed.
   The new syntax more closely mimics the order of arguments you might
   pass to svn checkout: the optional revision flags come first, then the
   external Subversion repository URL, and finally the relative local
   subdirectory. Notice, though, that this time we didn't say âfully
   qualified, absolute Subversion repository URLs.â That's because the new
   format supports relative URLs and URLs that carry peg revisions. The
   previous example of an externals definition might, in Subversion 1.5,
   look like the following:
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
      http://svn.example.com/repos/sounds third-party/sounds
-r148 http://svn.example.com/skinproj third-party/skins
-r21  http://svn.example.com/skin-maker third-party/skins/toolkit

   Or, making use of the peg revision syntax (which we describe in detail
   in the section called âPeg and Operative Revisionsâ), it might appear
   as:
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
http://svn.example.com/repos/sounds third-party/sounds
http://svn.example.com/skinproj@148 third-party/skins
http://svn.example.com/skin-maker@21 third-party/skins/toolkit

Tip

   You should seriously consider using explicit revision numbers in all of
   your externals definitions. Doing so means that you get to decide when
   to pull down a different snapshot of external information, and exactly
   which snapshot to pull. Besides avoiding the surprise of getting
   changes to third-party repositories that you might not have any control
   over, using explicit revision numbers also means that as you backdate
   your working copy to a previous revision, your externals definitions
   will also revert to the way they looked in that previous revision,
   which in turn means that the external working copies will be updated to
   match the way they looked back when your repository was at that
   previous revision. For software projects, this could be the difference
   between a successful and a failed build of an older snapshot of your
   complex codebase.

   For most repositories, these three ways of formatting the externals
   definitions have the same ultimate effect. They all bring the same
   benefits. Unfortunately, they all bring the same annoyances, too. Since
   the definitions shown use absolute URLs, moving or copying a directory
   to which they are attached will not affect what gets checked out as an
   external (though the relative local target subdirectory will, of
   course, move with the renamed directory). This can be confusingâeven
   frustratingâin certain situations. For example, say you have a
   top-level directory named my-project, and you've created an externals
   definition on one of its subdirectories (my-project/some-dir) that
   tracks the latest revision of another of its subdirectories
   (my-project/external-dir).
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/projects .
A    my-project
A    my-project/some-dir
A    my-project/external-dir
â¦
Fetching external item into 'my-project/some-dir/subdir'
Checked out external at revision 11.

Checked out revision 11.
$ svn propget svn:externals my-project/some-dir
subdir http://svn.example.com/projects/my-project/external-dir

$

   Now you use svn move to rename the my-project directory. At this point,
   your externals definition will still refer to a path under the
   my-project directory, even though that directory no longer exists.
$ svn move -q my-project renamed-project
$ svn commit -m "Rename my-project to renamed-project."
Deleting       my-project
Adding         renamed-project

Committed revision 12.
$ svn update

Fetching external item into 'renamed-project/some-dir/subdir'
svn: Target path does not exist
$

   Also, absolute URLs can cause problems with repositories that are
   available via multiple URL schemes. For example, if your Subversion
   server is configured to allow everyone to check out the repository over
   http:// or https://, but only allow commits to come in via https://,
   you have an interesting problem on your hands. If your externals
   definitions use the http:// form of the repository URLs, you won't be
   able to commit anything from the working copies created by those
   externals. On the other hand, if they use the https:// form of the
   URLs, anyone who might be checking out via http:// because his client
   doesn't support https:// will be unable to fetch the external items. Be
   aware, too, that if you need to reparent your working copy (using svn
   switch with the --relocate option), externals definitions will not also
   be reparented.

   Subversion 1.5 takes a huge step in relieving these frustrations. As
   mentioned earlier, the URLs used in the new externals definition format
   can be relative, and Subversion provides syntax magic for specifying
   multiple flavors of URL relativity.

   ../
          Relative to the URL of the directory on which the svn:externals
          property is set

   ^/
          Relative to the root of the repository in which the
          svn:externals property is versioned

   //
          Relative to the scheme of the URL of the directory on which the
          svn:externals property is set

   /
          Relative to the root URL of the server on which the
          svn:externals property is versioned

   So, looking a fourth time at our previous externals definition example,
   and making use of the new absolute URL syntax in various ways, we might
   now see:
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
^/sounds third-party/sounds
/skinproj@148 third-party/skins
//svn.example.com/skin-maker@21 third-party/skins/toolkit

   The support that exists for externals definitions in Subversion remains
   less than ideal, though. An externals definition can point only to
   directories, not to files. Also, the local subdirectory part of the
   definition cannot contain .. parent directory indicators (such as
   ../../skins/myskin). Perhaps most disappointingly, the working copies
   created via the externals definition support are still disconnected
   from the primary working copy (on whose versioned directories the
   svn:externals property was actually set). And Subversion still truly
   operates only on nondisjoint working copies. So, for example, if you
   want to commit changes that you've made in one or more of those
   external working copies, you must run svn commit explicitly on those
   working copiesâcommitting on the primary working copy will not recurse
   into any external ones.

   We've already mentioned some of the additional shortcomings of the old
   svn:externals format and how the new Subversion 1.5 format improves
   upon it. But be careful when making use of the new format that you
   don't inadvertently cause problems for other folks accessing your
   repository who are using older Subversion clients. While Subversion 1.5
   clients will continue to recognize and support the original externals
   definition format, older clients will not be able to correctly parse
   the new format.

   Besides the svn checkout, svn update, svn switch, and svn export
   commands which actually manage the disjoint (or disconnected)
   subdirectories into which externals are checked out, the svn status
   command also recognizes externals definitions. It displays a status
   code of X for the disjoint external subdirectories, and then recurses
   into those subdirectories to display the status of the external items
   themselves. You can pass the --ignore-externals option to any of these
   subcommands to disable externals definition processing.

Peg and Operative Revisions

   We copy, move, rename, and completely replace files and directories on
   our computers all the time. And your version control system shouldn't
   get in the way of your doing these things with your version-controlled
   files and directories, either. Subversion's file management support is
   quite liberating, affording almost as much flexibility for versioned
   files as you'd expect when manipulating your unversioned ones. But that
   flexibility means that across the lifetime of your repository, a given
   versioned object might have many paths, and a given path might
   represent several entirely different versioned objects. This introduces
   a certain level of complexity to your interactions with those paths and
   objects.

   Subversion is pretty smart about noticing when an object's version
   history includes such âchanges of address.â For example, if you ask for
   the revision history log of a particular file that was renamed last
   week, Subversion happily provides all those logsâthe revision in which
   the rename itself happened, plus the logs of relevant revisions both
   before and after that rename. So, most of the time, you don't even have
   to think about such things. But occasionally, Subversion needs your
   help to clear up ambiguities.

   The simplest example of this occurs when a directory or file is deleted
   from version control, and then a new directory or file is created with
   the same name and added to version control. The thing you deleted and
   the thing you later added aren't the same thing. They merely happen to
   have had the same pathâ/trunk/object, for example. What, then, does it
   mean to ask Subversion about the history of /trunk/object? Are you
   asking about the thing currently at that location, or the old thing you
   deleted from that location? Are you asking about the operations that
   have happened to all the objects that have ever lived at that path?
   Subversion needs a hint about what you really want.

   And thanks to moves, versioned object history can get far more twisted
   than even that. For example, you might have a directory named concept,
   containing some nascent software project you've been toying with.
   Eventually, though, that project matures to the point that the idea
   seems to actually have some wings, so you do the unthinkable and decide
   to give the project a name. ^[17] Let's say you called your software
   Frabnaggilywort. At this point, it makes sense to rename the directory
   to reflect the project's new name, so concept is renamed to
   frabnaggilywort. Life goes on, Frabnaggilywort releases a 1.0 version
   and is downloaded and used daily by hordes of people aiming to improve
   their lives.

   It's a nice story, really, but it doesn't end there. Entrepreneur that
   you are, you've already got another think in the tank. So you make a
   new directory, concept, and the cycle begins again. In fact, the cycle
   begins again many times over the years, each time starting with that
   old concept directory, then sometimes seeing that directory renamed as
   the idea cures, sometimes seeing it deleted when you scrap the idea.
   Or, to get really sick, maybe you rename concept to something else for
   a while, but later rename the thing back to concept for some reason.

   In scenarios like these, attempting to instruct Subversion to work with
   these reused paths can be a little like instructing a motorist in
   Chicago's West Suburbs to drive east down Roosevelt Road and turn left
   onto Main Street. In a mere 20 minutes, you can cross âMain Streetâ in
   Wheaton, Glen Ellyn, and Lombard. And no, they aren't the same street.
   Our motoristâand our Subversionâneed a little more detail to do the
   right thing.

   In version 1.1, Subversion introduced a way for you to tell it exactly
   which Main Street you meant. It's called the peg revision, and it is
   provided to Subversion for the sole purpose of identifying a unique
   line of history. Because at most, one versioned object may occupy a
   path at any given timeâor, more precisely, in any one revisionâthe
   combination of a path and a peg revision is all that is needed to refer
   to a specific line of history. Peg revisions are specified to the
   Subversion command-line client using at syntax, so called because the
   syntax involves appending an âat signâ (@) and the peg revision to the
   end of the path with which the revision is associated.

   But what of the --revision (-r) of which we've spoken so much in this
   book? That revision (or set of revisions) is called the operative
   revision (or operative revision range). Once a particular line of
   history has been identified using a path and peg revision, Subversion
   performs the requested operation using the operative revision(s). To
   map this to our Chicagoland streets analogy, if we are told to go to
   606 N. Main Street in Wheaton, ^[18] we can think of âMain Streetâ as
   our path and âWheatonâ as our peg revision. These two pieces of
   information identify a unique path that can be traveled (north or south
   on Main Street), and they keep us from traveling up and down the wrong
   Main Street in search of our destination. Now we throw in â606 N.â as
   our operative revision of sorts, and we know exactly where to go.

   The Peg Revision Algorithm

   The Subversion command-line client performs the peg revision algorithm
   any time it needs to resolve possible ambiguities in the paths and
   revisions provided to it. Here's an example of such an invocation:
$ svn command -r OPERATIVE-REV item@PEG-REV

   If OPERATIVE-REV is older than PEG-REV, the algorithm is as follows:
    1. Locate item in the revision identified by PEG-REV. There can be
       only one such object.
    2. Trace the object's history backwards (through any possible renames)
       to its ancestor in the revision OPERATIVE-REV.
    3. Perform the requested action on that ancestor, wherever it is
       located, or whatever its name might be or might have been at that
       time.

   But what if OPERATIVE-REV is younger than PEG-REV? Well, that adds some
   complexity to the theoretical problem of locating the path in
   OPERATIVE-REV, because the path's history could have forked multiple
   times (thanks to copy operations) between PEG-REV and OPERATIVE-REV.
   And that's not allâSubversion doesn't store enough information to
   performantly trace an object's history forward, anyway. So the
   algorithm is a little different:
    1. Locate item in the revision identified by OPERATIVE-REV. There can
       be only one such object.
    2. Trace the object's history backward (through any possible renames)
       to its ancestor in the revision PEG-REV.
    3. Verify that the object's location (path-wise) in PEG-REV is the
       same as it is in OPERATIVE-REV. If that's the case, at least the
       two locations are known to be directly related, so perform the
       requested action on the location in OPERATIVE-REV. Otherwise,
       relatedness was not established, so error out with a loud complaint
       that no viable location was found. (Someday, we expect that
       Subversion will be able to handle this usage scenario with more
       flexibility and grace.)

   Note that even when you don't explicitly supply a peg revision or
   operative revision, they are still present. For your convenience, the
   default peg revision is BASE for working copy items and HEAD for
   repository URLs. And when no operative revision is provided, it
   defaults to being the same revision as the peg revision.

   Say that long ago we created our repository, and in revision 1 we added
   our first concept directory, plus an IDEA file in that directory
   talking about the concept. After several revisions in which real code
   was added and tweaked, we, in revision 20, renamed this directory to
   frabnaggilywort. By revision 27, we had a new concept, a new concept
   directory to hold it, and a new IDEA file to describe it. And then five
   years and thousands of revisions flew by, just like they would in any
   good romance story.

   Now, years later, we wonder what the IDEA file looked like back in
   revision 1. But Subversion needs to know whether we are asking about
   how the current file looked back in revision 1, or whether we are
   asking for the contents of whatever file lived at concepts/IDEA in
   revision 1. Certainly those questions have different answers, and
   because of peg revisions, you can ask those questions. To find out how
   the current IDEA file looked in that old revision, you run:
$ svn cat -r 1 concept/IDEA
svn: Unable to find repository location for 'concept/IDEA' in revision 1

   Of course, in this example, the current IDEA file didn't exist yet in
   revision 1, so Subversion gives an error. The previous command is
   shorthand for a longer notation which explicitly lists a peg revision.
   The expanded notation is:
$ svn cat -r 1 concept/IDEA@BASE
svn: Unable to find repository location for 'concept/IDEA' in revision 1

   And when executed, it has the expected results.

   The perceptive reader is probably wondering at this point whether the
   peg revision syntax causes problems for working copy paths or URLs that
   actually have at signs in them. After all, how does svn know whether
   news@11 is the name of a directory in my tree or just a syntax for
   ârevision 11 of newsâ? Thankfully, while svn will always assume the
   latter, there is a trivial workaround. You need only append an at sign
   to the end of the path, such as news@11@. svn cares only about the last
   at sign in the argument, and it is not considered illegal to omit a
   literal peg revision specifier after that at sign. This workaround even
   applies to paths that end in an at signâyou would use filename@@ to
   talk about a file named filename@.

   Let's ask the other question, thenâin revision 1, what were the
   contents of whatever file occupied the address concepts/IDEA at the
   time? We'll use an explicit peg revision to help us out.
$ svn cat concept/IDEA@1
The idea behind this project is to come up with a piece of software
that can frab a naggily wort.  Frabbing naggily worts is tricky
business, and doing it incorrectly can have serious ramifications, so
we need to employ over-the-top input validation and data verification
mechanisms.

   Notice that we didn't provide an operative revision this time. That's
   because when no operative revision is specified, Subversion assumes a
   default operative revision that's the same as the peg revision.

   As you can see, the output from our operation appears to be correct.
   The text even mentions frabbing naggily worts, so this is almost
   certainly the file that describes the software now called
   Frabnaggilywort. In fact, we can verify this using the combination of
   an explicit peg revision and explicit operative revision. We know that
   in HEAD, the Frabnaggilywort project is located in the frabnaggilywort
   directory. So we specify that we want to see how the line of history
   identified in HEAD as the path frabnaggilywort/IDEA looked in revision
   1.
$ svn cat -r 1 frabnaggilywort/IDEA@HEAD

we need to employ over-the-top input validation and data verification

   And the peg and operative revisions need not be so trivial, either. For
   example, say frabnaggilywort had been deleted from HEAD, but we know it
   existed in revision 20, and we want to see the diffs for its IDEA file
   between revisions 4 and 10. We can use the peg revision 20 in
   conjunction with the URL that would have held Frabnaggilywort's IDEA
   file in revision 20, and then use 4 and 10 as our operative revision
   range.

   Fortunately, most folks aren't faced with such complex situations. But
   when you are, remember that peg revisions are that extra hint
   Subversion needs to clear up ambiguity.

Changelists

   It is commonplace for a developer to find himself working at any given
   time on multiple different, distinct changes to a particular bit of
   source code. This isn't necessarily due to poor planning or some form
   of digital masochism. A software engineer often spots bugs in his
   peripheral vision while working on some nearby chunk of source code. Or
   perhaps he's halfway through some large change when he realizes the
   solution he's working on is best committed as several smaller logical
   units. Often, these logical units aren't nicely contained in some
   module, safely separated from other changes. The units might overlap,
   modifying different files in the same module, or even modifying
   different lines in the same file.

   Developers can employ various work methodologies to keep these logical
   changes organized. Some use separate working copies of the same
   repository to hold each individual change in progress. Others might
   choose to create short-lived feature branches in the repository and use
   a single working copy that is constantly switched to point to one such
   branch or another. Still others use diff and patch tools to back up and
   restore uncommitted changes to and from patch files associated with
   each change. Each of these methods has its pros and cons, and to a
   large degree, the details of the changes being made heavily influence
   the methodology used to distinguish them.

   Subversion 1.5 brings a new changelists feature that adds yet another
   method to the mix. Changelists are basically arbitrary labels
   (currently at most one per file) applied to working copy files for the
   express purpose of associating multiple files together. Users of many
   of Google's software offerings are familiar with this concept already.
   For example, Gmail doesn't provide the traditional folders-based email
   organization mechanism. In Gmail, you apply arbitrary labels to emails,
   and multiple emails can be said to be part of the same group if they
   happen to share a particular label. Viewing only a group of similarly
   labeled emails then becomes a simple user interface trick. Many other
   Web 2.0 sites have similar mechanismsâconsider the âtagsâ used by sites
   such as YouTube and Flickr, âcategoriesâ applied to blog posts, and so
   on. Folks understand today that organization of data is critical, but
   that how that data is organized needs to be a flexible concept. The old
   files-and-folders paradigm is too rigid for some applications.

   Subversion's changelist support allows you to create changelists by
   applying labels to files you want to be associated with that
   changelist, remove those labels, and limit the scope of the files on
   which its subcommands operate to only those bearing a particular label.
   In this section, we'll look in detail at how to do these things.

Creating and Modifying Changelists

   You can create, modify, and delete changelists using the svn changelist
   command. More accurately, you use this command to set or unset the
   changelist association of a particular working copy file. A changelist
   is effectively created the first time you label a file with that
   changelist; it is deleted when you remove that label from the last file
   that had it. Let's examine a usage scenario that demonstrates these
   concepts.

   Harry is fixing some bugs in the calculator application's mathematics
   logic. His work leads him to change a couple of files:
$ svn status
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$

   While testing his bug fix, Harry notices that his changes bring to
   light a tangentially related bug in the user interface logic found in
   button.c. Harry decides that he'll go ahead and fix that bug, too, as a
   separate commit from his math fixes. Now, in a small working copy with
   only a handful of files and few logical changes, Harry can probably
   keep his two logical change groupings mentally organized without any
   problem. But today he's going to use Subversion's changelists feature
   as a special favor to the authors of this book.

   Harry first creates a changelist and associates with it the two files
   he's already changed. He does this by using the svn changelist command
   to assign the same arbitrary changelist name to those files:
$ svn changelist math-fixes integer.c mathops.c
Path 'integer.c' is now a member of changelist 'math-fixes'.
Path 'mathops.c' is now a member of changelist 'math-fixes'.
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$

   As you can see, the output of svn status reflects this new grouping.

   Harry now sets off to fix the secondary UI problem. Since he knows
   which file he'll be changing, he assigns that path to a changelist,
   too. Unfortunately, Harry carelessly assigns this third file to the
   same changelist as the previous two files:
$ svn changelist math-fixes button.c
Path 'button.c' is now a member of changelist 'math-fixes'.
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
       button.c
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$

   Fortunately, Harry catches his mistake. At this point, he has two
   options. He can remove the changelist association from button.c, and
   then assign a different changelist name:
$ svn changelist --remove button.c
Path 'button.c' is no longer a member of a changelist.
$ svn changelist ui-fix button.c
Path 'button.c' is now a member of changelist 'ui-fix'.
$

   Or, he can skip the removal and just assign a new changelist name. In
   this case, Subversion will first warn Harry that button.c is being
   removed from the first changelist:
$ svn changelist ui-fix button.c
svn: warning: Removing 'button.c' from changelist 'math-fixes'.
Path 'button.c' is now a member of changelist 'ui-fix'.
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'ui-fix':
       button.c

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$

   Harry now has two distinct changelists present in his working copy, and
   svn status will group its output according to these changelist
   determinations. Notice that even though Harry hasn't yet modified
   button.c, it still shows up in the output of svn status as interesting
   because it has a changelist assignment. Changelists can be added to and
   removed from files at any time, regardless of whether they contain
   local modifications.

   Harry now fixes the user interface problem in button.c.
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'ui-fix':
M      button.c

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$

Changelists As Operation Filters

   The visual grouping that Harry sees in the output of svn status as
   shown in our previous section is nice, but not entirely useful. The
   status command is but one of many operations that he might wish to
   perform on his working copy. Fortunately, many of Subversion's other
   operations understand how to operate on changelists via the use of the
   --changelist option.

   When provided with a --changelist option, Subversion commands will
   limit the scope of their operation to only those files to which a
   particular changelist name is assigned. If Harry now wants to see the
   actual changes he's made to the files in his math-fixes changelist, he
   could explicitly list only the files that make up that changelist on
   the svn diff command line.
$ svn diff integer.c mathops.c
Index: integer.c
===================================================================
--- integer.c   (revision 1157)
+++ integer.c   (working copy)
â¦
Index: mathops.c
===================================================================
--- mathops.c   (revision 1157)
+++ mathops.c   (working copy)
â¦
$

   That works okay for a few files, but what if Harry's change touched 20
   or 30 files? That would be an annoyingly long list of explicitly named
   files. Now that he's using changelists, though, Harry can avoid
   explicitly listing the set of files in his changelist from now on, and
   instead provide just the changelist name:
$ svn diff --changelist math-fixes
Index: integer.c
===================================================================
--- integer.c   (revision 1157)
+++ integer.c   (working copy)
â¦
Index: mathops.c
===================================================================
--- mathops.c   (revision 1157)
+++ mathops.c   (working copy)
â¦
$

   And when it's time to commit, Harry can again use the --changelist
   option to limit the scope of the commit to files in a certain
   changelist. He might commit his user interface fix by doing the
   following:
$ svn ci -m "Fix a UI bug found while working on math logic." \
      --changelist ui-fix
Sending        button.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 1158.
$

   In fact, the svn commit command provides a second changelists-related
   option: --keep-changelists. Normally, changelist assignments are
   removed from files after they are committed. But if --keep-changelists
   is provided, Subversion will leave the changelist assignment on the
   committed (and now unmodified) files. In any case, committing files
   assigned to one changelist leaves other changelists undisturbed.
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$

Note

   The --changelist option acts only as a filter for Subversion command
   targets, and will not add targets to an operation. For example, on a
   commit operation specified as svn commit /path/to/dir, the target is
   the directory /path/to/dir and its children (to infinite depth). If you
   then add a changelist specifier to that command, only those files in
   and under /path/to/dir that are assigned that changelist name will be
   considered as targets of the commitâthe commit will not include files
   located elsewhere (such is in /path/to/another-dir), regardless of
   their changelist assignment, even if they are part of the same working
   copy as the operation's target(s).

   Even the svn changelist command accepts the --changelist option. This
   allows you to quickly and easily rename or remove a changelist:
$ svn changelist math-bugs --changelist math-fixes --depth infinity .
svn: warning: Removing 'integer.c' from changelist 'math-fixes'.
Path 'integer.c' is now a member of changelist 'math-bugs'.
svn: warning: Removing 'mathops.c' from changelist 'math-fixes'.
Path 'mathops.c' is now a member of changelist 'math-bugs'.
$ svn changelist --remove --changelist math-bugs --depth infinity .
Path 'integer.c' is no longer a member of a changelist.
Path 'mathops.c' is no longer a member of a changelist.
$

   Finally, you can specify multiple instances of the --changelist option
   on a single command line. Doing so limits the operation you are
   performing to files found in any of the specified changesets.

Changelist Limitations

   Subversion's changelist feature is a handy tool for grouping working
   copy files, but it does have a few limitations. Changelists are
   artifacts of a particular working copy, which means that changelist
   assignments cannot be propagated to the repository or otherwise shared
   with other users. Changelists can be assigned only to filesâSubversion
   doesn't currently support the use of changelists with directories.
   Finally, you can have at most one changelist assignment on a given
   working copy file. Here is where the blog post category and photo
   service tag analogies break downâif you find yourself needing to assign
   a file to multiple changelists, you're out of luck.

Network Model

   At some point, you're going to need to understand how your Subversion
   client communicates with its server. Subversion's networking layer is
   abstracted, meaning that Subversion clients exhibit the same general
   behaviors no matter what sort of server they are operating against.
   Whether speaking the HTTP protocol (http://) with the Apache HTTP
   Server or speaking the custom Subversion protocol (svn://) with
   svnserve, the basic network model is the same. In this section, we'll
   explain the basics of that network model, including how Subversion
   manages authentication and authorization matters.

Requests and Responses

   The Subversion client spends most of its time managing working copies.
   When it needs information from a remote repository, however, it makes a
   network request, and the server responds with an appropriate answer.
   The details of the network protocol are hidden from the userâthe client
   attempts to access a URL, and depending on the URL scheme, a particular
   protocol is used to contact the server (see the sidebar Repository
   URLs).

Tip

   Run svn --version to see which URL schemes and protocols the client
   knows how to use.

   When the server process receives a client request, it often demands
   that the client identify itself. It issues an authentication challenge
   to the client, and the client responds by providing credentials back to
   the server. Once authentication is complete, the server responds with
   the original information that the client asked for. Notice that this
   system is different from systems such as CVS, where the client
   preemptively offers credentials (âlogs inâ) to the server before ever
   making a request. In Subversion, the server âpullsâ credentials by
   challenging the client at the appropriate moment, rather than the
   client âpushingâ them. This makes certain operations more elegant. For
   example, if a server is configured to allow anyone in the world to read
   a repository, the server will never issue an authentication challenge
   when a client attempts to svn checkout.

   If the particular network requests issued by the client result in a new
   revision being created in the repository (e.g., svn commit), Subversion
   uses the authenticated username associated with those requests as the
   author of the revision. That is, the authenticated user's name is
   stored as the value of the svn:author property on the new revision (see
   the section called âSubversion Propertiesâ). If the client was not
   authenticated (i.e., if the server never issued an authentication
   challenge), the revision's svn:author property is empty.

Client Credentials Caching

   Many servers are configured to require authentication on every request.
   This would be a big annoyance to users if they were forced to type
   their passwords over and over again. Fortunately, the Subversion client
   has a remedy for thisâa built-in system for caching authentication
   credentials on disk. By default, whenever the command-line client
   successfully responds to a server's authentication challenge, it saves
   the credentials in the user's private runtime configuration area
   (~/.subversion/auth/ on Unix-like systems or %APPDATA%/Subversion/auth/
   on Windows; see the section called âRuntime Configuration Areaâ for
   more details about the runtime configuration system). Successful
   credentials are cached on disk and keyed on a combination of the
   server's hostname, port, and authentication realm.

   When the client receives an authentication challenge, it first looks
   for the appropriate credentials in the user's disk cache. If seemingly
   suitable credentials are not present, or if the cached credentials
   ultimately fail to authenticate, the client will, by default, fall back
   to prompting the user for the necessary information.

   The security-conscious reader will suspect immediately that there is
   reason for concern here. âCaching passwords on disk? That's terrible!
   You should never do that!â

   The Subversion developers recognize the legitimacy of such concerns,
   and so Subversion works with available mechanisms provided by the
   operating system and environment to try to minimize the risk of leaking
   this information. Here's a breakdown of what this means for users on
   the most common platforms:
     * On Windows 2000 and later, the Subversion client uses standard
       Windows cryptography services to encrypt the password on disk.
       Because the encryption key is managed by Windows and is tied to the
       user's own login credentials, only the user can decrypt the cached
       password. (Note that if the user's Windows account password is
       reset by an administrator, all of the cached passwords become
       undecipherable. The Subversion client will behave as though they
       don't exist, prompting for passwords when required.)
     * Similarly, on Mac OS X, the Subversion client stores all repository
       passwords in the login keyring (managed by the Keychain service),
       which is protected by the user's account password. User preference
       settings can impose additional policies, such as requiring that the
       user's account password be entered each time the Subversion
       password is used.
     * For other Unix-like operating systems, no standard âkeychainâ
       services exist. However, the auth/ caching area is still
       permission-protected so that only the user (owner) can read data
       from it, not the world at large. The operating system's own file
       permissions protect the passwords.

   Of course, for the truly paranoid, none of these mechanisms meets the
   test of perfection. So for those folks willing to sacrifice convenience
   for the ultimate in security, Subversion provides various ways of
   disabling its credentials caching system altogether.

   To disable caching for a single command, pass the --no-auth-cache
   option:
$ svn commit -F log_msg.txt --no-auth-cache
Authentication realm: <svn://host.example.com:3690> example realm
Username:  joe
Password for 'joe':

Adding         newfile
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 2324.

# password was not cached, so a second commit still prompts us

$ svn delete newfile
$ svn commit -F new_msg.txt
Authentication realm: <svn://host.example.com:3690> example realm
Username:  joe
â¦

   Or, if you want to disable credential caching permanently, you can edit
   the config file in your runtime configuration area and set the
   store-auth-creds option to no. This will prevent the storing of
   credentials used in any Subversion interactions you perform on the
   affected computer. This can be extended to cover all users on the
   computer, too, by modifying the system-wide runtime configuration area
   (described in the section called âConfiguration Area Layoutâ).
[auth]
store-auth-creds = no

   Sometimes users will want to remove specific credentials from the disk
   cache. To do this, you need to navigate into the auth/ area and
   manually delete the appropriate cache file. Credentials are cached in
   individual files; if you look inside each file, you will see keys and
   values. The svn:realmstring key describes the particular server realm
   that the file is associated with:
$ ls ~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/
5671adf2865e267db74f09ba6f872c28
3893ed123b39500bca8a0b382839198e
5c3c22968347b390f349ff340196ed39

$ cat ~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/5671adf2865e267db74f09ba6f872c28

K 8
username
V 3
joe
K 8
password
V 4
blah
K 15
svn:realmstring
V 45
<https://svn.domain.com:443> Joe's repository
END

   Once you have located the proper cache file, just delete it.

   One last word about svn's authentication behavior, specifically
   regarding the --username and --password options. Many client
   subcommands accept these options, but it is important to understand
   that using these options does not automatically send credentials to the
   server. As discussed earlier, the server âpullsâ credentials from the
   client when it deems necessary; the client cannot âpushâ them at will.
   If a username and/or password are passed as options, they will be
   presented to the server only if the server requests them. These options
   are typically used to authenticate as a different user than Subversion
   would have chosen by default (such as your system login name) or when
   trying to avoid interactive prompting (such as when calling svn from a
   script).

Note

   A common mistake is to misconfigure a server so that it never issues an
   authentication challenge. When users pass --username and --password
   options to the client, they're surprised to see that they're never
   used; that is, new revisions still appear to have been committed
   anonymously!

   Here is a final summary that describes how a Subversion client behaves
   when it receives an authentication challenge.
    1. First, the client checks whether the user specified any credentials
       as command-line options (--username and/or --password). If so, the
       client will try to use those credentials to authenticate against
       the server.
    2. If no command-line credentials were provided, or the provided ones
       were invalid, the client looks up the server's hostname, port, and
       realm in the runtime configuration's auth/ area, to see whether
       appropriate credentials are cached there. If so, it attempts to use
       those credentials to authenticate.
    3. Finally, if the previous mechanisms failed to successfully
       authenticate the user against the server, the client resorts to
       interactively prompting the user for valid credentials (unless
       instructed not to do so via the --non-interactive option or its
       client-specific equivalents).

   If the client successfully authenticates by any of these methods, it
   will attempt to cache the credentials on disk (unless the user has
   disabled this behavior, as mentioned earlier).

Summary

   After reading this chapter, you should have a firm grasp on some of
   Subversion's features that, while perhaps not used every time you
   interact with your version control system, are certainly handy to know
   about. But don't stop here! Read on to the following chapter, where
   you'll learn about branches, tags, and merging. Then you'll have nearly
   full mastery of the Subversion client. Though our lawyers won't allow
   us to promise you anything, this additional knowledge could make you
   measurably more cool. ^[19]

   Branching, tagging, and merging are concepts common to almost all
   version control systems. If you're not familiar with these ideas, we
   provide a good introduction in this chapter. If you are familiar,
   hopefully you'll find it interesting to see how Subversion implements
   them.

   Branching is a fundamental part of version control. If you're going to
   allow Subversion to manage your data, this is a feature you'll
   eventually come to depend on. This chapter assumes that you're already
   familiar with Subversion's basic concepts (Chapter 1, Fundamental
   Concepts).

What's a Branch?

   Suppose it's your job to maintain a document for a division in your
   companyâa handbook of some sort. One day a different division asks you
   for the same handbook, but with a few parts âtweakedâ for them, since
   they do things slightly differently.

   What do you do in this situation? You do the obvious: make a second
   copy of your document and begin maintaining the two copies separately.
   As each department asks you to make small changes, you incorporate them
   into one copy or the other.

   You often want to make the same change to both copies. For example, if
   you discover a typo in the first copy, it's very likely that the same
   typo exists in the second copy. The two documents are almost the same,
   after all; they differ only in small, specific ways.

   This is the basic concept of a branchânamely, a line of development
   that exists independently of another line, yet still shares a common
   history if you look far enough back in time. A branch always begins
   life as a copy of something, and moves on from there, generating its
   own history (see Figure 4.1, âBranches of developmentâ).

   Figure 4.1. Branches of development
   Branches of development

   Subversion has commands to help you maintain parallel branches of your
   files and directories. It allows you to create branches by copying your
   data, and remembers that the copies are related to one another. It also
   helps you duplicate changes from one branch to another. Finally, it can
   make portions of your working copy reflect different branches so that
   you can âmix and matchâ different lines of development in your daily
   work.

Using Branches

   At this point, you should understand how each commit creates an
   entirely new filesystem tree (called a ârevisionâ) in the repository.
   If you don't, go back and read about revisions in the section called
   âRevisionsâ.

   For this chapter, we'll go back to the same example from Chapter 1,
   Fundamental Concepts. Remember that you and your collaborator, Sally,
   are sharing a repository that contains two projects, paint and calc.
   Notice that in Figure 4.2, âStarting repository layoutâ, however, each
   project directory now contains subdirectories named trunk and branches.
   The reason for this will soon become clear.

   Figure 4.2. Starting repository layout
   Starting repository layout

   As before, assume that Sally and you both have working copies of the
   âcalcâ project. Specifically, you each have a working copy of
   /calc/trunk. All the files for the project are in this subdirectory
   rather than in /calc itself, because your team has decided that
   /calc/trunk is where the âmain lineâ of development is going to take
   place.

   Let's say that you've been given the task of implementing a large
   software feature. It will take a long time to write, and will affect
   all the files in the project. The immediate problem is that you don't
   want to interfere with Sally, who is in the process of fixing small
   bugs here and there. She's depending on the fact that the latest
   version of the project (in /calc/trunk) is always usable. If you start
   committing your changes bit by bit, you'll surely break things for
   Sally (and other team members as well).

   One strategy is to crawl into a hole: you and Sally can stop sharing
   information for a week or two. That is, start gutting and reorganizing
   all the files in your working copy, but don't commit or update until
   you're completely finished with the task. There are a number of
   problems with this, though. First, it's not very safe. Most people like
   to save their work to the repository frequently, should something bad
   accidentally happen to their working copy. Second, it's not very
   flexible. If you do your work on different computers (perhaps you have
   a working copy of /calc/trunk on two different machines), you'll need
   to manually copy your changes back and forth or just do all the work on
   a single computer. By that same token, it's difficult to share your
   changes in progress with anyone else. A common software development
   âbest practiceâ is to allow your peers to review your work as you go.
   If nobody sees your intermediate commits, you lose potential feedback
   and may end up going down the wrong path for weeks before another
   person on your team notices. Finally, when you're finished with all
   your changes, you might find it very difficult to remerge your final
   work with the rest of the company's main body of code. Sally (or
   others) may have made many other changes in the repository that are
   difficult to incorporate into your working copyâespecially if you run
   svn update after weeks of isolation.

   The better solution is to create your own branch, or line of
   development, in the repository. This allows you to save your
   half-broken work frequently without interfering with others, yet you
   can still selectively share information with your collaborators. You'll
   see exactly how this works as we go.

Creating a Branch

   Creating a branch is very simpleâyou make a copy of the project in the
   repository using the svn copy command. Subversion is able to copy not
   only single files, but whole directories as well. In this case, you
   want to make a copy of the /calc/trunk directory. Where should the new
   copy live? Wherever you wishâit's a matter of project policy. Let's say
   that your team has a policy of creating branches in the /calc/branches
   area of the repository, and you want to name your branch
   my-calc-branch. You'll want to create a new directory,
   /calc/branches/my-calc-branch, which begins its life as a copy of
   /calc/trunk.

   You may already have seen svn copy used to copy one file to another
   within a working copy. But it can also be used to do a âremoteâ copy
   entirely within the repository. Just copy one URL to another:
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
      -m "Creating a private branch of /calc/trunk."

Committed revision 341.

   This command causes a near-instantaneous commit in the repository,
   creating a new directory in revision 341. The new directory is a copy
   of /calc/trunk. This is shown in Figure 4.3, âRepository with new
   copyâ. ^[20] While it's also possible to create a branch by using svn
   copy to duplicate a directory within the working copy, this technique
   isn't recommended. It can be quite slow, in fact! Copying a directory
   on the client side is a linear-time operation, in that it actually has
   to duplicate every file and subdirectory on the local disk. Copying a
   directory on the server, however, is a constant-time operation, and
   it's the way most people create branches.

   Figure 4.3. Repository with new copy
   Repository with new copy

   Cheap Copies

   Subversion's repository has a special design. When you copy a
   directory, you don't need to worry about the repository growing
   hugeâSubversion doesn't actually duplicate any data. Instead, it
   creates a new directory entry that points to an existing tree. If
   you're an experienced Unix user, you'll recognize this as the same
   concept behind a hard link. As further changes are made to files and
   directories beneath the copied directory, Subversion continues to
   employ this hard link concept where it can. It duplicates data only
   when it is necessary to disambiguate different versions of objects.

   This is why you'll often hear Subversion users talk about âcheap
   copies.â It doesn't matter how large the directory isâit takes a very
   tiny, constant amount of time and space to make a copy of it. In fact,
   this feature is the basis of how commits work in Subversion: each
   revision is a âcheap copyâ of the previous revision, with a few items
   lazily changed within. (To read more about this, visit Subversion's web
   site and read about the âbubble upâ method in Subversion's design
   documents.)

   Of course, these internal mechanics of copying and sharing data are
   hidden from the user, who simply sees copies of trees. The main point
   here is that copies are cheap, both in time and in space. If you create
   a branch entirely within the repository (by running svn copy URL1
   URL2), it's a quick, constant-time operation. Make branches as often as
   you want.

Working with Your Branch

   Now that you've created a branch of the project, you can check out a
   new working copy to start using it:
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch
A  my-calc-branch/Makefile
A  my-calc-branch/integer.c
A  my-calc-branch/button.c
Checked out revision 341.

   There's nothing special about this working copy; it simply mirrors a
   different directory in the repository. When you commit changes,
   however, Sally won't see them when she updates, because her working
   copy is of /calc/trunk. (Be sure to read the section called âTraversing
   Branchesâ later in this chapter: the svn switch command is an
   alternative way of creating a working copy of a branch.)

   Let's pretend that a week goes by, and the following commits happen:
     * You make a change to /calc/branches/my-calc-branch/button.c, which
       creates revision 342.
     * You make a change to /calc/branches/my-calc-branch/integer.c, which
       creates revision 343.
     * Sally makes a change to /calc/trunk/integer.c, which creates
       revision 344.

   Now two independent lines of development (shown in Figure 4.4, âThe
   branching of one file's historyâ) are happening on integer.c.

   Figure 4.4. The branching of one file's history
   The branching of one file's history

   Things get interesting when you look at the history of changes made to
   your copy of integer.c:
$ pwd
/home/user/my-calc-branch

$ svn log -v integer.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r343 | user | 2002-11-07 15:27:56 -0600 (Thu, 07 Nov 2002) | 2 lines

   M /calc/branches/my-calc-branch/integer.c

* integer.c:  frozzled the wazjub.

Changed paths:
   A /calc/trunk/integer.c

* integer.c:  adding this file to the project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Notice that Subversion is tracing the history of your branch's
   integer.c all the way back through time, even traversing the point
   where it was copied. It shows the creation of the branch as an event in
   the history, because integer.c was implicitly copied when all of
   /calc/trunk/ was copied. Now look at what happens when Sally runs the
   same command on her copy of the file:
$ pwd
/home/sally/calc

$ svn log -v integer.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r344 | sally | 2002-11-07 15:27:56 -0600 (Thu, 07 Nov 2002) | 2 lines
Changed paths:
   M /calc/trunk/integer.c

* integer.c:  fix a bunch of spelling errors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r303 | sally | 2002-10-29 21:14:35 -0600 (Tue, 29 Oct 2002) | 2 lines
Changed paths:
   M /calc/trunk/integer.c

* integer.c:  changed a docstring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r98 | sally | 2002-02-22 15:35:29 -0600 (Fri, 22 Feb 2002) | 2 lines
Changed paths:
   A /calc/trunk/integer.c

* integer.c:  adding this file to the project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Sally sees her own revision 344 change, but not the change you made in
   revision 343. As far as Subversion is concerned, these two commits
   affected different files in different repository locations. However,
   Subversion does show that the two files share a common history. Before
   the branch copy was made in revision 341, the files used to be the same
   file. That's why you and Sally both see the changes made in revisions
   303 and 98.

The Key Concepts Behind Branching

   You should remember two important lessons from this section. First,
   Subversion has no internal concept of a branchâit knows only how to
   make copies. When you copy a directory, the resultant directory is only
   a âbranchâ because you attach that meaning to it. You may think of the
   directory differently, or treat it differently, but to Subversion it's
   just an ordinary directory that happens to carry some extra historical
   information.

   Second, because of this copy mechanism, Subversion's branches exist as
   normal filesystem directories in the repository. This is different from
   other version control systems, where branches are typically defined by
   adding extra-dimensional âlabelsâ to collections of files. The location
   of your branch directory doesn't matter to Subversion. Most teams
   follow a convention of putting all branches into a /branches directory,
   but you're free to invent any policy you wish.

Basic Merging

   Now you and Sally are working on parallel branches of the project:
   you're working on a private branch, and Sally is working on the trunk,
   or main line of development.

   For projects that have a large number of contributors, it's common for
   most people to have working copies of the trunk. Whenever someone needs
   to make a long-running change that is likely to disrupt the trunk, a
   standard procedure is to create a private branch and commit changes
   there until all the work is complete.

   So, the good news is that you and Sally aren't interfering with each
   other. The bad news is that it's very easy to drift too far apart.
   Remember that one of the problems with the âcrawl in a holeâ strategy
   is that by the time you're finished with your branch, it may be
   near-impossible to merge your changes back into the trunk without a
   huge number of conflicts.

   Instead, you and Sally might continue to share changes as you work.
   It's up to you to decide which changes are worth sharing; Subversion
   gives you the ability to selectively âcopyâ changes between branches.
   And when you're completely finished with your branch, your entire set
   of branch changes can be copied back into the trunk. In Subversion
   terminology, the general act of replicating changes from one branch to
   another is called merging, and it is performed using various
   invocations of the svn merge command.

   In the examples that follow, we're assuming that both your Subversion
   client and server are running Subversion 1.5 (or later). If either
   client or server is older than version 1.5, things are more
   complicated: the system won't track changes automatically, and you'll
   have to use painful manual methods to achieve similar results. That is,
   you'll always need to use the detailed merge syntax to specify specific
   ranges of revisions to replicate (see the section called âMerge Syntax:
   Full Disclosureâ later in this chapter), and take special care to keep
   track of what's already been merged and what hasn't. For this reason,
   we strongly recommend that you make sure your client and server are at
   least at version 1.5.

Changesets

   Before we proceed further, we should warn you that there's going to be
   a lot of discussion of âchangesâ in the pages ahead. A lot of people
   experienced with version control systems use the terms âchangeâ and
   âchangesetâ interchangeably, and we should clarify what Subversion
   understands as a changeset.

   Everyone seems to have a slightly different definition of changeset, or
   at least a different expectation of what it means for a version control
   system to have one. For our purposes, let's say that a changeset is
   just a collection of changes with a unique name. The changes might
   include textual edits to file contents, modifications to tree
   structure, or tweaks to metadata. In more common speak, a changeset is
   just a patch with a name you can refer to.

   In Subversion, a global revision number N names a tree in the
   repository: it's the way the repository looked after the Nth commit.
   It's also the name of an implicit changeset: if you compare tree N with
   tree Nâ1, you can derive the exact patch that was committed. For this
   reason, it's easy to think of revision N as not just a tree, but a
   changeset as well. If you use an issue tracker to manage bugs, you can
   use the revision numbers to refer to particular patches that fix
   bugsâfor example, âthis issue was fixed by r9238.â Somebody can then
   run svn log -r 9238 to read about the exact changeset that fixed the
   bug, and run svn diff -c 9238 to see the patch itself. And (as you'll
   see shortly) Subversion's svn merge command is able to use revision
   numbers. You can merge specific changesets from one branch to another
   by naming them in the merge arguments: passing -c 9238 to svn merge
   would merge changeset r9238 into your working copy.

Keeping a Branch in Sync

   Continuing with our running example, let's suppose that a week has
   passed since you started working on your private branch. Your new
   feature isn't finished yet, but at the same time you know that other
   people on your team have continued to make important changes in the
   project's /trunk. It's in your best interest to replicate those changes
   to your own branch, just to make sure they mesh well with your changes.
   In fact, this is a best practice: frequently keeping your branch in
   sync with the main development line helps prevent âsurpriseâ conflicts
   when it comes time for you to fold your changes back into the trunk.

   Subversion is aware of the history of your branch and knows when it
   divided away from the trunk. To replicate the latest, greatest trunk
   changes to your branch, first make sure your working copy of the branch
   is âcleanââthat it has no local modifications reported by svn status.
   Then simply run:
$ pwd
/home/user/my-calc-branch

$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk
--- Merging r345 through r356 into '.':
U    button.c
U    integer.c

   This basic syntaxâsvn merge URLâtells Subversion to merge all recent
   changes from the URL to the current working directory (which is
   typically the root of your working copy). After running the prior
   example, your branch working copy now contains new local modifications,
   and these edits are duplications of all of the changes that have
   happened on the trunk since you first created your branch:
$ svn status
 M     .
M      button.c
M      integer.c

   At this point, the wise thing to do is look at the changes carefully
   with svn diff, and then build and test your branch. Notice that the
   current working directory (â.â) has also been modified; the svn diff
   will show that its svn:mergeinfo property has been either created or
   modified. This is important merge-related metadata that you should not
   touch, since it will be needed by future svn merge commands. (We'll
   learn more about this metadata later in the chapter.)

   After performing the merge, you might also need to resolve some
   conflicts (just as you do with svn update) or possibly make some small
   edits to get things working properly. (Remember, just because there are
   no syntactic conflicts doesn't mean there aren't any semantic
   conflicts!) If you encounter serious problems, you can always abort the
   local changes by running svn revert . -R (which will undo all local
   modifications) and start a long âwhat's going on?â discussion with your
   collaborators. If things look good, however, you can submit these
   changes into the repository:
$ svn commit -m "Merged latest trunk changes to my-calc-branch."
Sending        .
Sending        button.c
Sending        integer.c
Transmitting file data ..
Committed revision 357.

   At this point, your private branch is now âin syncâ with the trunk, so
   you can rest easier knowing that as you continue to work in isolation,
   you're not drifting too far away from what everyone else is doing.

   Why Not Use Patches Instead?

   A question may be on your mind, especially if you're a Unix user: why
   bother to use svn merge at all? Why not simply use the operating
   system's patch command to accomplish the same job? For example:
$ cd my-calc-branch
$ svn diff -r 341:HEAD http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk > patchfile
$ patch -p0  < patchfile
Patching file integer.c using Plan A...
Hunk #1 succeeded at 147.
Hunk #2 succeeded at 164.
Hunk #3 succeeded at 241.
Hunk #4 succeeded at 249.
done

   In this particular example, there really isn't much difference. But svn
   merge has special abilities that surpass the patch program. The file
   format used by patch is quite limited; it's able to tweak file contents
   only. There's no way to represent changes to trees, such as the
   addition, removal, or renaming of files and directories. Nor can the
   patch program notice changes to properties. If Sally's change had, say,
   added a new directory, the output of svn diff wouldn't have mentioned
   it at all. svn diff outputs only the limited patch format, so there are
   some ideas it simply can't express.

   The svn merge command, however, can express changes in tree structure
   and properties by directly applying them to your working copy. Even
   more important, this command records the changes that have been
   duplicated to your branch so that Subversion is aware of exactly which
   changes exist in each location (see the section called âMergeinfo and
   Previewsâ.) This is a critical feature that makes branch management
   usable; without it, users would have to manually keep notes on which
   sets of changes have or haven't been merged yet.

   Suppose that another week has passed. You've committed more changes to
   your branch, and your comrades have continued to improve the trunk as
   well. Once again, you'd like to replicate the latest trunk changes to
   your branch and bring yourself in sync. Just run the same merge command
   again!
$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk
--- Merging r357 through r380 into '.':
U    integer.c
U    Makefile
A    README

   Subversion knows which trunk changes you've already replicated to your
   branch, so it carefully replicates only those changes you don't yet
   have. Once again, you'll have to build, test, and svn commit the local
   modifications to your branch.

   What happens when you finally finish your work, though? Your new
   feature is done, and you're ready to merge your branch changes back to
   the trunk (so your team can enjoy the bounty of your labor). The
   process is simple. First, bring your branch in sync with the trunk
   again, just as you've been doing all along:
$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk
--- Merging r381 through r385 into '.':
U    button.c
U    README

$ # build, test, ...

$ svn commit -m "Final merge of trunk changes to my-calc-branch."
Sending        .
Sending        button.c
Sending        README
Transmitting file data ..
Committed revision 390.

   Now, you use svn merge to replicate your branch changes back into the
   trunk. You'll need an up-to-date working copy of /trunk. You can do
   this by either doing an svn checkout, dredging up an old trunk working
   copy from somewhere on your disk, or using svn switch (see the section
   called âTraversing Branchesâ.) However you get a trunk working copy,
   remember that it's a best practice to do your merge into a working copy
   that has no local edits and has been recently updated (i.e., is not a
   mixture of local revisions). If your working copy isn't âcleanâ in
   these ways, you can run into some unnecessary conflict-related
   headaches and svn merge will likely return an error.

   Once you have a clean working copy of the trunk, you're ready to merge
   your branch back into it:
$ pwd
/home/user/calc-trunk

$ svn update  # (make sure the working copy is up to date)
At revision 390.

$ svn merge --reintegrate http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-br
anch
--- Merging differences between repository URLs into '.':
U    button.c
U    integer.c
U    Makefile
 U   .

$ # build, test, verify, ...

$ svn commit -m "Merge my-calc-branch back into trunk!"
Sending        .
Sending        button.c
Sending        integer.c
Sending        Makefile
Transmitting file data ..
Committed revision 391.

   Congratulations, your branch has now been remerged back into the main
   line of development. Notice our use of the --reintegrate option this
   time around. The option is critical for reintegrating changes from a
   branch back into its original line of developmentâdon't forget it! It's
   needed because this sort of âmerge backâ is a different sort of work
   than what you've been doing up until now. Previously, we had been
   asking svn merge to grab the ânext setâ of changes from one line of
   development (the trunk) and duplicate them to another (your branch).
   This is fairly straightforward, and each time Subversion knows how to
   pick up where it left off. In our prior examples, you can see that
   first it merges the ranges 345:356 from trunk to branch; later on, it
   continues by merging the next contiguously available range, 356:380.
   When doing the final sync, it merges the range 380:385.

   When merging your branch back to the trunk, however, the underlying
   mathematics is quite different. Your feature branch is now a mishmosh
   of both duplicated trunk changes and private branch changes, so there's
   no simple contiguous range of revisions to copy over. By specifying the
   --reintegrate option, you're asking Subversion to carefully replicate
   only those changes unique to your branch. (And in fact, it does this by
   comparing the latest trunk tree with the latest branch tree: the
   resulting difference is exactly your branch changes!)

   Now that your private branch is merged to trunk, you may wish to remove
   it from the repository:
$ svn delete http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
      -m "Remove my-calc-branch."
Committed revision 392.

   But wait! Isn't the history of that branch valuable? What if somebody
   wants to audit the evolution of your feature someday and look at all of
   your branch changes? No need to worry. Remember that even though your
   branch is no longer visible in the /branches directory, its existence
   is still an immutable part of the repository's history. A simple svn
   log command on the /branches URL will show the entire history of your
   branch. Your branch can even be resurrected at some point, should you
   desire (see the section called âResurrecting Deleted Itemsâ).

   In Subversion 1.5, once a --reintegrate merge is done from branch to
   trunk, the branch is no longer usable for further work. It's not able
   to correctly absorb new trunk changes, nor can it be properly
   reintegrated to trunk again. For this reason, if you want to keep
   working on your feature branch, we recommend destroying it and then
   re-creating it from the trunk:
$ svn delete http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
      -m "Remove my-calc-branch."
Committed revision 392.

$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/new-branch
      -m "Create a new branch from trunk."
Committed revision 393.

$ cd my-calc-branch

$ svn switch http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/new-branch
Updated to revision 393.

   The final command in the prior exampleâsvn switchâis a way of updating
   an existing working copy to reflect a different repository directory.
   We'll discuss this more in the section called âTraversing Branchesâ.

Mergeinfo and Previews

   The basic mechanism Subversion uses to track changesetsâthat is, which
   changes have been merged to which branchesâis by recording data in
   properties. Specifically, merge data is tracked in the svn:mergeinfo
   property attached to files and directories. (If you're not familiar
   with Subversion properties, now is the time to skim the section called
   âPropertiesâ.)

   You can examine the property, just like any other:
$ cd my-calc-branch
$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:341-390

   It is not recommended that you change the value of this property
   yourself, unless you really know what you're doing. This property is
   automatically maintained by Subversion whenever you run svn merge. Its
   value indicates which changes (at a given path) have been replicated
   into the directory in question. In this case, the path is /trunk and
   the directory which has received the specific changes is
   /branches/my-calc-branch.

   There's also a subcommand, svn mergeinfo, which can be helpful in
   seeing not only which changesets a directory has absorbed, but also
   which changesets it's still eligible to receive. This gives a sort of
   preview of the next set of changes that svn merge will replicate to
   your branch.
$ cd my-calc-branch

# Which changes have already been merged from trunk to branch?
$ svn mergeinfo http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk
r341
r342
r343
â¦
r388
r389
r390

# Which changes are still eligible to merge from trunk to branch?
$ svn mergeinfo http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk --show-revs eligible
r391
r392
r393
r394
r395

   The svn mergeinfo command requires a âsourceâ URL (where the changes
   would be coming from), and takes an optional âtargetâ URL (where the
   changes would be merged to). If no target URL is given, it assumes that
   the current working directory is the target. In the prior example,
   because we're querying our branch working copy, the command assumes
   we're interested in receiving changes to /branches/mybranch from the
   specified trunk URL.

   Another way to get a more precise preview of a merge operation is to
   use the --dry-run option:
$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk --dry-run
U    integer.c

$ svn status
#  nothing printed, working copy is still unchanged.

   The --dry-run option doesn't actually apply any local changes to the
   working copy. It shows only status codes that would be printed in a
   real merge. It's useful for getting a âhigh-levelâ preview of the
   potential merge, for those times when running svn diff gives too much
   detail.

Tip

   After performing a merge operation, but before committing the results
   of the merge, you can use svn diff --depth=empty /path/to/merge/target
   to see only the changes to the immediate target of your merge. If your
   merge target was a directory, only property differences will be
   displayed. This is a handy way to see the changes to the svn:mergeinfo
   property recorded by the merge operation, which will remind you about
   what you've just merged.

   Of course, the best way to preview a merge operation is to just do it!
   Remember, running svn merge isn't an inherently risky thing (unless
   you've made local modifications to your working copyâbut we've already
   stressed that you shouldn't be merging into such an environment). If
   you don't like the results of the merge, simply run svn revert . -R to
   revert the changes from your working copy and retry the command with
   different options. The merge isn't final until you actually svn commit
   the results.

Tip

   While it's perfectly fine to experiment with merges by running svn
   merge and svn revert over and over, you may run into some annoying (but
   easily bypassed) roadblocks. For example, if the merge operation adds a
   new file (i.e., schedules it for addition), svn revert won't actually
   remove the file; it simply unschedules the addition. You're left with
   an unversioned file. If you then attempt to run the merge again, you
   may get conflicts due to the unversioned file âbeing in the way.â
   Solution? After performing a revert, be sure to clean up the working
   copy and remove unversioned files and directories. The output of svn
   status should be as clean as possible, ideally showing no output.

Undoing Changes

   An extremely common use for svn merge is to roll back a change that has
   already been committed. Suppose you're working away happily on a
   working copy of /calc/trunk, and you discover that the change made way
   back in revision 303, which changed integer.c, is completely wrong. It
   never should have been committed. You can use svn merge to âundoâ the
   change in your working copy, and then commit the local modification to
   the repository. All you need to do is to specify a reverse difference.
   (You can do this by specifying --revision 303:302, or by an equivalent
   --change -303.)
$ svn merge -c -303 http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk
--- Reverse-merging r303 into 'integer.c':
U    integer.c

$ svn status
 M     .
M      integer.c

$ svn diff
â¦
# verify that the change is removed
â¦

$ svn commit -m "Undoing change committed in r303."
Sending        integer.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 350.

   As we mentioned earlier, one way to think about a repository revision
   is as a specific changeset. By using the -r option, you can ask svn
   merge to apply a changeset, or a whole range of changesets, to your
   working copy. In our case of undoing a change, we're asking svn merge
   to apply changeset #303 to our working copy backward.

   Keep in mind that rolling back a change like this is just like any
   other svn merge operation, so you should use svn status and svn diff to
   confirm that your work is in the state you want it to be in, and then
   use svn commit to send the final version to the repository. After
   committing, this particular changeset is no longer reflected in the
   HEAD revision.

   Again, you may be thinking: well, that really didn't undo the commit,
   did it? The change still exists in revision 303. If somebody checks out
   a version of the calc project between revisions 303 and 349, she'll
   still see the bad change, right?

   Yes, that's true. When we talk about âremovingâ a change, we're really
   talking about removing it from the HEAD revision. The original change
   still exists in the repository's history. For most situations, this is
   good enough. Most people are only interested in tracking the HEAD of a
   project anyway. There are special cases, however, where you really
   might want to destroy all evidence of the commit. (Perhaps somebody
   accidentally committed a confidential document.) This isn't so easy, it
   turns out, because Subversion was deliberately designed to never lose
   information. Revisions are immutable trees that build upon one another.
   Removing a revision from history would cause a domino effect, creating
   chaos in all subsequent revisions and possibly invalidating all working
   copies. ^[21]

Resurrecting Deleted Items

   The great thing about version control systems is that information is
   never lost. Even when you delete a file or directory, it may be gone
   from the HEAD revision, but the object still exists in earlier
   revisions. One of the most common questions new users ask is, âHow do I
   get my old file or directory back?â

   The first step is to define exactly which item you're trying to
   resurrect. Here's a useful metaphor: you can think of every object in
   the repository as existing in a sort of two-dimensional coordinate
   system. The first coordinate is a particular revision tree, and the
   second coordinate is a path within that tree. So every version of your
   file or directory can be defined by a specific coordinate pair.
   (Remember the âpeg revisionâ syntaxâfoo.c@224âmentioned back in the
   section called âPeg and Operative Revisionsâ.)

   First, you might need to use svn log to discover the exact coordinate
   pair you wish to resurrect. A good strategy is to run svn log --verbose
   in a directory that used to contain your deleted item. The --verbose
   (-v) option shows a list of all changed items in each revision; all you
   need to do is find the revision in which you deleted the file or
   directory. You can do this visually, or by using another tool to
   examine the log output (via grep, or perhaps via an incremental search
   in an editor).
$ cd parent-dir
$ svn log -v
â¦
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r808 | joe | 2003-12-26 14:29:40 -0600 (Fri, 26 Dec 2003) | 3 lines
Changed paths:
   D /calc/trunk/real.c
   M /calc/trunk/integer.c

Added fast fourier transform functions to integer.c.
Removed real.c because code now in double.c.
â¦

   In the example, we're assuming that you're looking for a deleted file
   real.c. By looking through the logs of a parent directory, you've
   spotted that this file was deleted in revision 808. Therefore, the last
   version of the file to exist was in the revision right before that.
   Conclusion: you want to resurrect the path /calc/trunk/real.c from
   revision 807.

   That was the hard partâthe research. Now that you know what you want to
   restore, you have two different choices.

   One option is to use svn merge to apply revision 808 âin reverse.â (We
   already discussed how to undo changes in the section called âUndoing
   Changesâ.) This would have the effect of re-adding real.c as a local
   modification. The file would be scheduled for addition, and after a
   commit, the file would again exist in HEAD.

   In this particular example, however, this is probably not the best
   strategy. Reverse-applying revision 808 would not only schedule real.c
   for addition, but the log message indicates that it would also undo
   certain changes to integer.c, which you don't want. Certainly, you
   could reverse-merge revision 808 and then svn revert the local
   modifications to integer.c, but this technique doesn't scale well. What
   if 90 files were changed in revision 808?

   A second, more targeted strategy is not to use svn merge at all, but
   rather to use the svn copy command. Simply copy the exact revision and
   path âcoordinate pairâ from the repository to your working copy:
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk/real.c@807 ./real.c

$ svn status
A  +   real.c

$ svn commit -m "Resurrected real.c from revision 807, /calc/trunk/real.c."
Adding         real.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 1390.

   The plus sign in the status output indicates that the item isn't merely
   scheduled for addition, but scheduled for addition âwith history.â
   Subversion remembers where it was copied from. In the future, running
   svn log on this file will traverse back through the file's resurrection
   and through all the history it had prior to revision 807. In other
   words, this new real.c isn't really new; it's a direct descendant of
   the original, deleted file. This is usually considered a good and
   useful thing. If, however, you wanted to resurrect the file without
   maintaining a historical link to the old file, this technique works
   just as well:
$ svn cat http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk/real.c@807 > ./real.c

$ svn add real.c
A         real.c

$ svn commit -m "Re-created real.c from revision 807."
Adding         real.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 1390.

   Although our example shows us resurrecting a file, note that these same
   techniques work just as well for resurrecting deleted directories. Also
   note that a resurrection doesn't have to happen in your working copyâit
   can happen entirely in the repository:
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk/real.c@807 \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk/ \
      -m "Resurrect real.c from revision 807."
Committed revision 1390.

$ svn update
A    real.c
Updated to revision 1390.

Advanced Merging

   Here ends the automated magic. Sooner or later, once you get the hang
   of branching and merging, you're going to have to ask Subversion to
   merge specific changes from one place to another. To do this, you're
   going to have to start passing more complicated arguments to svn merge.
   The next section describes the fully expanded syntax of the command and
   discusses a number of common scenarios that require it.

Cherrypicking

   Just as the term âchangesetâ is often used in version control systems,
   so is the term cherrypicking. This word refers to the act of choosing
   one specific changeset from a branch and replicating it to another.
   Cherrypicking may also refer to the act of duplicating a particular set
   of (not necessarily contiguous!) changesets from one branch to another.
   This is in contrast to more typical merging scenarios, where the ânextâ
   contiguous range of revisions is duplicated automatically.

   Why would people want to replicate just a single change? It comes up
   more often than you'd think. For example, let's go back in time and
   imagine that you haven't yet merged your private feature branch back to
   the trunk. At the water cooler, you get word that Sally made an
   interesting change to integer.c on the trunk. Looking over the history
   of commits to the trunk, you see that in revision 355 she fixed a
   critical bug that directly impacts the feature you're working on. You
   might not be ready to merge all the trunk changes to your branch just
   yet, but you certainly need that particular bug fix in order to
   continue your work.
$ svn diff -c 355 http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk

Index: integer.c
===================================================================
--- integer.c   (revision 354)
+++ integer.c   (revision 355)

     case 6:  sprintf(info->operating_system, "HPFS (OS/2 or NT)"); break;
     case 7:  sprintf(info->operating_system, "Macintosh"); break;
     case 8:  sprintf(info->operating_system, "Z-System"); break;

     case 11:  sprintf(info->operating_system, "NTFS (Windows NT)"); break;
     case 12:  sprintf(info->operating_system, "QDOS"); break;

   Just as you used svn diff in the prior example to examine revision 355,
   you can pass the same option to svn merge:
$ svn merge -c 355 http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk
U    integer.c

$ svn status
M      integer.c

   You can now go through the usual testing procedures before committing
   this change to your branch. After the commit, Subversion marks r355 as
   having been merged to the branch so that future âmagicâ merges that
   synchronize your branch with the trunk know to skip over r355. (Merging
   the same change to the same branch almost always results in a
   conflict!)
$ cd my-calc-branch

$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:341-349,355

# Notice that r355 isn't listed as "eligible" to merge, because
# it's already been merged.
$ svn mergeinfo http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk --show-revs eligible

 U   .
U    integer.c
U    Makefile
--- Merging r356 through r360 into '.':
 U   .
U    integer.c
U    button.c

   This use case of replicating (or backporting) bug fixes from one branch
   to another is perhaps the most popular reason for cherrypicking
   changes; it comes up all the time, for example, when a team is
   maintaining a ârelease branchâ of software. (We discuss this pattern in
   the section called âRelease Branchesâ.)

Warning

   Did you notice how, in the last example, the merge invocation caused
   two distinct ranges of merges to be applied? The svn merge command
   applied two independent patches to your working copy to skip over
   changeset 355, which your branch already contained. There's nothing
   inherently wrong with this, except that it has the potential to make
   conflict resolution trickier. If the first range of changes creates
   conflicts, you must resolve them interactively for the merge process to
   continue and apply the second range of changes. If you postpone a
   conflict from the first wave of changes, the whole merge command will
   bail out with an error message. ^[22]

   A word of warning: while svn diff and svn merge are very similar in
   concept, they do have different syntax in many cases. Be sure to read
   about them in Chapter 9, Subversion Complete Reference for details, or
   ask svn help. For example, svn merge requires a working copy path as a
   target, that is, a place where it should apply the generated patch. If
   the target isn't specified, it assumes you are trying to perform one of
   the following common operations:
     * You want to merge directory changes into your current working
       directory.
     * You want to merge the changes in a specific file into a file by the
       same name that exists in your current working directory.

   If you are merging a directory and haven't specified a target path, svn
   merge assumes the first case and tries to apply the changes into your
   current directory. If you are merging a file, and that file (or a file
   by the same name) exists in your current working directory, svn merge
   assumes the second case and tries to apply the changes to a local file
   with the same name.

Merge Syntax: Full Disclosure

   You've now seen some examples of the svn merge command, and you're
   about to see several more. If you're feeling confused about exactly how
   merging works, you're not alone. Many users (especially those new to
   version control) are initially perplexed about the proper syntax of the
   command and about how and when the feature should be used. But fear
   not, this command is actually much simpler than you think! There's a
   very easy technique for understanding exactly how svn merge behaves.

   The main source of confusion is the name of the command. The term
   âmergeâ somehow denotes that branches are combined together, or that
   some sort of mysterious blending of data is going on. That's not the
   case. A better name for the command might have been svn diff-and-apply,
   because that's all that happens: two repository trees are compared, and
   the differences are applied to a working copy.

   If you're using svn merge to do basic copying of changes between
   branches, it will generally do the right thing automatically. For
   example, a command such as the following:
$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/some-branch

   will attempt to duplicate any changes made on some-branch into your
   current working directory, which is presumably a working copy that
   shares some historical connection to the branch. The command is smart
   enough to only duplicate changes that your working copy doesn't yet
   have. If you repeat this command once a week, it will only duplicate
   the ânewestâ branch changes that happened since you last merged.

   If you choose to use the svn merge command in all its full glory by
   giving it specific revision ranges to duplicate, the command takes
   three main arguments:
    1. An initial repository tree (often called the left side of the
       comparison)
    2. A final repository tree (often called the right side of the
       comparison)
    3. A working copy to accept the differences as local changes (often
       called the target of the merge)

   Once these three arguments are specified, the two trees are compared,
   and the differences are applied to the target working copy as local
   modifications. When the command is done, the results are no different
   than if you had hand-edited the files or run various svn add or svn
   delete commands yourself. If you like the results, you can commit them.
   If you don't like the results, you can simply svn revert all of the
   changes.

   The syntax of svn merge allows you to specify the three necessary
   arguments rather flexibly. Here are some examples:
$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/branch1@150 \
            http://svn.example.com/repos/branch2@212 \
            my-working-copy

$ svn merge -r 100:200 http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk my-working-copy

$ svn merge -r 100:200 http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk

   The first syntax lays out all three arguments explicitly, naming each
   tree in the form URL@REV and naming the working copy target. The second
   syntax can be used as a shorthand for situations when you're comparing
   two different revisions of the same URL. The last syntax shows how the
   working copy argument is optional; if omitted, it defaults to the
   current directory.

   While the first example shows the âfullâ syntax of svn merge, it needs
   to be used very carefully; it can result in merges which do not record
   any svn:mergeinfo metadata at all. The next section talks a bit more
   about this.

Merges Without Mergeinfo

   Subversion tries to generate merge metadata whenever it can, to make
   future invocations of svn merge smarter. There are still situations,
   however, where svn:mergeinfo data is not created or changed. Remember
   to be a bit wary of these scenarios:

   Merging unrelated sources
          If you ask svn merge to compare two URLs that aren't related to
          each other, a patch will still be generated and applied to your
          working copy, but no merging metadata will be created. There's
          no common history between the two sources, and future âsmartâ
          merges depend on that common history.

   Merging from foreign repositories
          While it's possible to run a command such as svn merge -r
          100:200 http://svn.foreignproject.com/repos/trunk, the resultant
          patch will also lack any historical merge metadata. At time of
          this writing, Subversion has no way of representing different
          repository URLs within the svn:mergeinfo property.

   Using --ignore-ancestry
          If this option is passed to svn merge, it causes the merging
          logic to mindlessly generate differences the same way that svn
          diff does, ignoring any historical relationships. We discuss
          this later in the chapter in the section called âNoticing or
          Ignoring Ancestryâ.

   Applying reverse merges to a target's natural history
          Earlier in this chapter (the section called âUndoing Changesâ)
          we discussed how to use svn merge to apply a âreverse patchâ as
          a way of rolling back changes. If this technique is used to undo
          a change to an object's personal history (e.g., commit r5 to the
          trunk, then immediately roll back r5 using svn merge . -c -5),
          this sort of merge doesn't affect the recorded mergeinfo. ^[23]

More on Merge Conflicts

   Just like the svn update command, svn merge applies changes to your
   working copy. And therefore it's also capable of creating conflicts.
   The conflicts produced by svn merge, however, are sometimes different,
   and this section explains those differences.

   To begin with, assume that your working copy has no local edits. When
   you svn update to a particular revision, the changes sent by the server
   will always apply âcleanlyâ to your working copy. The server produces
   the delta by comparing two trees: a virtual snapshot of your working
   copy, and the revision tree you're interested in. Because the left hand
   side of the comparison is exactly equal to what you already have, the
   delta is guaranteed to correctly convert your working copy into the
   right hand tree.

   But svn merge has no such guarantees and can be much more chaotic: the
   advanced user can ask the server to compare any two trees at all, even
   ones that are unrelated to the working copy! This means there's large
   potential for human error. Users will sometimes compare the wrong two
   trees, creating a delta that doesn't apply cleanly. svn merge will do
   its best to apply as much of the delta as possible, but some parts may
   be impossible. Just as the Unix patch command sometimes complains about
   âfailed hunks,â svn merge will similarly complain about âskipped
   targetsâ:
$ svn merge -r 1288:1351 http://svn.example.com/repos/branch
U    foo.c
U    bar.c
Skipped missing target: 'baz.c'
U    glub.c
U    sputter.h

Conflict discovered in 'glorb.h'.
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
        (h) help for more options:

   In the previous example, it might be the case that baz.c exists in both
   snapshots of the branch being compared, and the resultant delta wants
   to change the file's contents, but the file doesn't exist in the
   working copy. Whatever the case, the âskippedâ message means that the
   user is most likely comparing the wrong two trees; it's the classic
   sign of user error. When this happens, it's easy to recursively revert
   all the changes created by the merge (svn revert . --recursive), delete
   any unversioned files or directories left behind after the revert, and
   rerun svn merge with different arguments.

   Also notice that the preceeding example shows a conflict happening on
   glorb.h. We already stated that the working copy has no local edits:
   how can a conflict possibly happen? Again, because the user can use svn
   merge to define and apply any old delta to the working copy, that delta
   may contain textual changes that don't cleanly apply to a working file,
   even if the file has no local modifications.

   Another small difference between svn update and svn merge is the names
   of the full-text files created when a conflict happens. In the section
   called âResolve Conflicts (Merging Others' Changes)â, we saw that an
   update produces files named filename.mine, filename.rOLDREV, and
   filename.rNEWREV. When svn merge produces a conflict, though, it
   creates three files named filename.working, filename.left, and
   filename.right. In this case, the terms âleftâ and ârightâ are
   describing which side of the double-tree comparison the file came from.
   In any case, these differing names will help you distinguish between
   conflicts that happened as a result of an update and ones that happened
   as a result of a merge.

Blocking Changes

   Sometimes there's a particular changeset that you don't want to be
   automatically merged. For example, perhaps your team's policy is to do
   new development work on /trunk, but to be more conservative about
   backporting changes to a stable branch you use for releasing to the
   public. On one extreme, you can manually cherrypick single changesets
   from the trunk to the branchâjust the changes that are stable enough to
   pass muster. Maybe things aren't quite that strict, though; perhaps
   most of the time you'd like to just let svn merge automatically merge
   most changes from trunk to branch. In this case, you'd like a way to
   mask a few specific changes out, that is, prevent them from ever being
   automatically merged.

   In Subversion 1.5, the only way to block a changeset is to make the
   system believe that the change has already been merged. To do this, one
   can invoke a merge command with the --record-only option:
$ cd my-calc-branch

$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:1680-3305

# Let's make the metadata list r3328 as already merged.
$ svn merge -c 3328 --record-only http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk

$ svn status
M     .

$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:1680-3305,3328

$ svn commit -m "Block r3328 from being merged to the branch."
â¦

   This technique works, but it's also a little bit dangerous. The main
   problem is that we're not clearly differentiating between the ideas of
   âI already have this changeâ and âI don't have this change.â We're
   effectively lying to the system, making it think that the change was
   previously merged. This puts the responsibility on youâthe userâto
   remember that the change wasn't actually merged, it just wasn't wanted.
   There's no way to ask Subversion for a list of âblocked changelists.â
   If you want to track them (so that you can unblock them someday).
   you'll need to record them in a text file somewhere, or perhaps in an
   invented property. In Subversion 1.5, unfortunately, this is the only
   way to manage blocked revisions; the plans are to make a better
   interface for this in future versions.

Merge-Sensitive Logs and Annotations

   One of the main features of any version control system is to keep track
   of who changed what, and when they did it. The svn log and svn blame
   commands are just the tools for this: when invoked on individual files,
   they show not only the history of changesets that affected the file,
   but also exactly which user wrote which line of code, and when she did
   it.

   When changes start getting replicated between branches, however, things
   start to get complicated. For example, if you were to ask svn log about
   the history of your feature branch, it would show exactly every
   revision that ever affected the branch:
$ cd my-calc-branch
$ svn log -q
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r390 | user | 2002-11-22 11:01:57 -0600 (Fri, 22 Nov 2002) | 1 line
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   But is this really an accurate picture of all the changes that happened
   on the branch? What's being left out here is the fact that revisions
   390, 381, and 357 were actually the results of merging changes from the
   trunk. If you look at one of these logs in detail, the multiple trunk
   changesets that comprised the branch change are nowhere to be seen:
$ svn log -v -r 390
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r390 | user | 2002-11-22 11:01:57 -0600 (Fri, 22 Nov 2002) | 1 line
Changed paths:
   M /branches/my-calc-branch/button.c
   M /branches/my-calc-branch/README

Final merge of trunk changes to my-calc-branch.

   We happen to know that this merge to the branch was nothing but a merge
   of trunk changes. How can we see those trunk changes as well? The
   answer is to use the --use-merge-history (-g) option. This option
   expands those âchildâ changes that were part of the merge.
$ svn log -v -r 390 -g
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r390 | user | 2002-11-22 11:01:57 -0600 (Fri, 22 Nov 2002) | 1 line

   M /branches/my-calc-branch/button.c

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r383 | sally | 2002-11-21 03:19:00 -0600 (Thu, 21 Nov 2002) | 2 lines

Changed paths:
   M /branches/my-calc-branch/README
Merged via: r390

Document my last fix in README.

   By making the log operation use merge history, we see not just the
   revision we queried (r390), but also the two revisions that came along
   on the ride with itâa couple of changes made by Sally to the trunk.
   This is a much more complete picture of history!

   The svn blame command also takes the --use-merge-history (-g) option.
   If this option is neglected, somebody looking at a line-by-line
   annotation of button.c may get the mistaken impression that you were
   responsible for the lines that fixed a certain error:
$ svn blame button.c
â¦
   390    user    retval = inverse_func(button, path);
   390    user    return retval;
   390    user    }
â¦

   And while it's true that you did actually commit those three lines in
   revision 390, two of them were actually written by Sally back in
   revision 383:
$ svn blame button.c -g
â¦
G    383    sally   retval = inverse_func(button, path);
G    383    sally   return retval;
     390    user    }
â¦

   Now we know who to really blame for those two lines of code!

Noticing or Ignoring Ancestry

   When conversing with a Subversion developer, you might very likely hear
   reference to the term ancestry. This word is used to describe the
   relationship between two objects in a repository: if they're related to
   each other, one object is said to be an ancestor of the other.

   For example, suppose you commit revision 100, which includes a change
   to a file foo.c. Then foo.c@99 is an âancestorâ of foo.c@100. On the
   other hand, suppose you commit the deletion of foo.c in revision 101,
   and then add a new file by the same name in revision 102. In this case,
   foo.c@99 and foo.c@102 may appear to be related (they have the same
   path), but in fact are completely different objects in the repository.
   They share no history or âancestry.â

   The reason for bringing this up is to point out an important difference
   between svn diff and svn merge. The former command ignores ancestry,
   while the latter command is quite sensitive to it. For example, if you
   asked svn diff to compare revisions 99 and 102 of foo.c, you would see
   line-based diffs; the diff command is blindly comparing two paths. But
   if you asked svn merge to compare the same two objects, it would notice
   that they're unrelated and first attempt to delete the old file, then
   add the new file; the output would indicate a deletion followed by an
   add:
D    foo.c
A    foo.c

   Most merges involve comparing trees that are ancestrally related to one
   another; therefore, svn merge defaults to this behavior. Occasionally,
   however, you may want the merge command to compare two unrelated trees.
   For example, you may have imported two source-code trees representing
   different vendor releases of a software project (see the section called
   âVendor Branchesâ). If you ask svn merge to compare the two trees,
   you'd see the entire first tree being deleted, followed by an add of
   the entire second tree! In these situations, you'll want svn merge to
   do a path-based comparison only, ignoring any relations between files
   and directories. Add the --ignore-ancestry option to your merge
   command, and it will behave just like svn diff. (And conversely, the
   --notice-ancestry option will cause svn diff to behave like the svn
   merge command.)

Merges and Moves

   A common desire is to refactor source code, especially in Java-based
   software projects. Files and directories are shuffled around and
   renamed, often causing great disruption to everyone working on the
   project. Sounds like a perfect case to use a branch, doesn't it? Just
   create a branch, shuffle things around, and then merge the branch back
   to the trunk, right?

   Alas, this scenario doesn't work so well right now and is considered
   one of Subversion's current weak spots. The problem is that
   Subversion's svn update command isn't as robust as it should be,
   particularly when dealing with copy and move operations.

   When you use svn copy to duplicate a file, the repository remembers
   where the new file came from, but it fails to transmit that information
   to the client which is running svn update or svn merge. Instead of
   telling the client, âCopy that file you already have to this new
   location,â it sends down an entirely new file. This can lead to
   problems, especially because the same thing happens with renamed files.
   A lesser-known fact about Subversion is that it lacks âtrue
   renamesââthe svn move command is nothing more than an aggregation of
   svn copy and svn delete.

   For example, suppose that while working on your private branch, you
   rename integer.c to whole.c. Effectively you've created a new file in
   your branch that is a copy of the original file, and deleted the
   original file. Meanwhile, back on trunk, Sally has committed some
   improvements to integer.c. Now you decide to merge your branch to the
   trunk:
$ cd calc/trunk

$ svn merge --reintegrate http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-br
anch
--- Merging differences between repository URLs into '.':
D   integer.c
A   whole.c
U   .

   This doesn't look so bad at first glance, but it's also probably not
   what you or Sally expected. The merge operation has deleted the latest
   version of the integer.c file (the one containing Sally's latest
   changes), and blindly added your new whole.c fileâwhich is a duplicate
   of the older version of integer.c. The net effect is that merging your
   ârenameâ to the branch has removed Sally's recent changes from the
   latest revision!

   This isn't true data loss. Sally's changes are still in the
   repository's history, but it may not be immediately obvious that this
   has happened. The moral of this story is that until Subversion
   improves, be very careful about merging copies and renames from one
   branch to another.

Blocking Merge-Unaware Clients

   If you've just upgraded your server to Subversion 1.5 or later, there's
   a significant risk that pre-1.5 Subversion clients can mess up your
   automated merge tracking. Why is this? When a pre-1.5 Subversion client
   performs svn merge, it doesn't modify the value of the svn:mergeinfo
   property at all. So the subsequent commit, despite being the result of
   a merge, doesn't tell the repository about the duplicated changesâthat
   information is lost. Later on, when âmerge-awareâ clients attempt
   automatic merging, they're likely to run into all sorts of conflicts
   resulting from repeated merges.

   If you and your team are relying on the merge-tracking features of
   Subversion, you may want to configure your repository to prevent older
   clients from committing changes. The easy way to do this is by
   inspecting the âcapabilitiesâ parameter in the start-commit hook
   script. If the client reports itself as having mergeinfo capabilities,
   the hook script can allow the commit to start. If the client doesn't
   report that capability, have the hook deny the commit. We'll learn more
   about hook scripts in the next chapter; see the section called
   âImplementing Repository Hooksâ and start-commit for details.

The Final Word on Merge Tracking

   The bottom line is that Subversion's merge-tracking feature has an
   extremely complex internal implementation, and the svn:mergeinfo
   property is the only window the user has into the machinery. Because
   the feature is relatively new, a numbers of edge cases and possible
   unexpected behaviors may pop up.

   For example, sometimes mergeinfo will be generated when running a
   simple svn copy or svn move command. Sometimes mergeinfo will appear on
   files that you didn't expect to be touched by an operation. Sometimes
   mergeinfo won't be generated at all, when you expect it to.
   Furthermore, the management of mergeinfo metadata has a whole set of
   taxonomies and behaviors around it, such as âexplicitâ versus
   âimplicitâ mergeinfo, âoperativeâ versus âinoperativeâ revisions,
   specific mechanisms of mergeinfo âelision,â and even âinheritanceâ from
   parent to child directories.

   We've chosen not to cover these detailed topics in this book for a
   couple of reasons. First, the level of detail is absolutely
   overwhelming for a typical user. Second, as Subversion continues to
   improve, we feel that a typical user shouldn't have to understand these
   concepts; they'll eventually fade into the background as pesky
   implementation details. All that said, if you enjoy this sort of thing,
   you can get a fantastic overview in a paper posted at CollabNet's
   website:
   http://www.collab.net/community/subversion/articles/merge-info.html.

   For now, if you want to steer clear of bugs and odd behaviors in
   automatic merging, the CollabNet article recommends that you stick to
   these simple best practices:
     * For short-term feature branches, follow the simple procedure
       described throughout the section called âBasic Mergingâ.
     * For long-lived release branches (as described in the section called
       âCommon Branching Patternsâ), perform merges only on the root of
       the branch, not on subdirectories.
     * Never merge into working copies with a mixture of working revision
       numbers, or with âswitchedâ subdirectories (as described next in
       the section called âTraversing Branchesâ). A merge target should be
       a working copy which represents a single location in the repository
       at a single point in time.
     * Don't ever edit the svn:mergeinfo property directly; use svn merge
       with the --record-only option to effect a desired change to the
       metadata (as demonstrated in the section called âBlocking
       Changesâ).
     * Always make sure you have complete read access to all of your merge
       sources, and that your target working copy has no sparse
       directories.

Traversing Branches

   The svn switch command transforms an existing working copy to reflect a
   different branch. While this command isn't strictly necessary for
   working with branches, it provides a nice shortcut. In our earlier
   example, after creating your private branch, you checked out a fresh
   working copy of the new repository directory. Instead, you can simply
   ask Subversion to change your working copy of /calc/trunk to mirror the
   new branch location:
$ cd calc

$ svn info | grep URL
URL: http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk

$ svn switch http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch
U   integer.c
U   button.c
U   Makefile
Updated to revision 341.

$ svn info | grep URL
URL: http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch

   âSwitchingâ a working copy that has no local modifications to a
   different branch results in the working copy looking just as it would
   if you'd done a fresh checkout of the directory. It's usually more
   efficient to use this command, because often branches differ by only a
   small degree. The server sends only the minimal set of changes
   necessary to make your working copy reflect the branch directory.

   The svn switch command also takes a --revision (-r) option, so you need
   not always move your working copy to the HEAD of the branch.

   Of course, most projects are more complicated than our calc example,
   and contain multiple subdirectories. Subversion users often follow a
   specific algorithm when using branches:
    1. Copy the project's entire âtrunkâ to a new branch directory.
    2. Switch only part of the trunk working copy to mirror the branch.

   In other words, if a user knows that the branch work needs to happen on
   only a specific subdirectory, she uses svn switch to move only that
   subdirectory to the branch. (Or sometimes users will switch just a
   single working file to the branch!) That way, the user can continue to
   receive normal âtrunkâ updates to most of her working copy, but the
   switched portions will remain immune (unless someone commits a change
   to her branch). This feature adds a whole new dimension to the concept
   of a âmixed working copyâânot only can working copies contain a mixture
   of working revisions, but they can also contain a mixture of repository
   locations as well.

   If your working copy contains a number of switched subtrees from
   different repository locations, it continues to function as normal.
   When you update, you'll receive patches to each subtree as appropriate.
   When you commit, your local changes will still be applied as a single,
   atomic change to the repository.

   Note that while it's okay for your working copy to reflect a mixture of
   repository locations, these locations must all be within the same
   repository. Subversion repositories aren't yet able to communicate with
   one another; that feature is planned for the future. ^[24]

   Switches and Updates

   Have you noticed that the output of svn switch and svn update looks the
   same? The switch command is actually a superset of the update command.

   When you run svn update, you're asking the repository to compare two
   trees. The repository does so, and then sends a description of the
   differences back to the client. The only difference between svn switch
   and svn update is that the latter command always compares two identical
   repository paths.

   That is, if your working copy is a mirror of /calc/trunk, svn update
   will automatically compare your working copy of /calc/trunk to
   /calc/trunk in the HEAD revision. If you're switching your working copy
   to a branch, svn switch will compare your working copy of /calc/trunk
   to some other branch directory in the HEAD revision.

   In other words, an update moves your working copy through time. A
   switch moves your working copy through time and space.

   Because svn switch is essentially a variant of svn update, it shares
   the same behaviors; any local modifications in your working copy are
   preserved when new data arrives from the repository.

Tip

   Have you ever found yourself making some complex edits (in your /trunk
   working copy) and suddenly realized, âHey, these changes ought to be in
   their own branch?â A great technique to do this can be summarized in
   two steps:
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/newbranch \
      -m "Create branch 'newbranch'."
Committed revision 353.
$ svn switch http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/newbranch
At revision 353.

   The svn switch command, like svn update, preserves your local edits. At
   this point, your working copy is now a reflection of the newly created
   branch, and your next svn commit invocation will send your changes
   there.

Tags

   Another common version control concept is a tag. A tag is just a
   âsnapshotâ of a project in time. In Subversion, this idea already seems
   to be everywhere. Each repository revision is exactly thatâa snapshot
   of the filesystem after each commit.

   However, people often want to give more human-friendly names to tags,
   such as release-1.0. And they want to make snapshots of smaller
   subdirectories of the filesystem. After all, it's not so easy to
   remember that release 1.0 of a piece of software is a particular
   subdirectory of revision 4822.

Creating a Simple Tag

   Once again, svn copy comes to the rescue. If you want to create a
   snapshot of /calc/trunk exactly as it looks in the HEAD revision, make
   a copy of it:
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/tags/release-1.0 \
      -m "Tagging the 1.0 release of the 'calc' project."

Committed revision 902.

   This example assumes that a /calc/tags directory already exists. (If it
   doesn't, you can create it using svn mkdir.) After the copy completes,
   the new release-1.0 directory is forever a snapshot of how the /trunk
   directory looked in the HEAD revision at the time you made the copy. Of
   course, you might want to be more precise about exactly which revision
   you copy, in case somebody else may have committed changes to the
   project when you weren't looking. So if you know that revision 901 of
   /calc/trunk is exactly the snapshot you want, you can specify it by
   passing -r 901 to the svn copy command.

   But wait a moment: isn't this tag creation procedure the same procedure
   we used to create a branch? Yes, in fact, it is. In Subversion, there's
   no difference between a tag and a branch. Both are just ordinary
   directories that are created by copying. Just as with branches, the
   only reason a copied directory is a âtagâ is because humans have
   decided to treat it that way: as long as nobody ever commits to the
   directory, it forever remains a snapshot. If people start committing to
   it, it becomes a branch.

   If you are administering a repository, there are two approaches you can
   take to managing tags. The first approach is âhands offâ: as a matter
   of project policy, decide where your tags will live, and make sure all
   users know how to treat the directories they copy. (That is, make sure
   they know not to commit to them.) The second approach is more paranoid:
   you can use one of the access control scripts provided with Subversion
   to prevent anyone from doing anything but creating new copies in the
   tags area (see Chapter 6, Server Configuration). The paranoid approach,
   however, isn't usually necessary. If a user accidentally commits a
   change to a tag directory, you can simply undo the change as discussed
   in the previous section. This is version control, after all!

Creating a Complex Tag

   Sometimes you may want your âsnapshotâ to be more complicated than a
   single directory at a single revision.

   For example, pretend your project is much larger than our calc example:
   suppose it contains a number of subdirectories and many more files. In
   the course of your work, you may decide that you need to create a
   working copy that is designed to have specific features and bug fixes.
   You can accomplish this by selectively backdating files or directories
   to particular revisions (using svn update with the -r option
   liberally), by switching files and directories to particular branches
   (making use of svn switch), or even just by making a bunch of local
   changes. When you're done, your working copy is a hodgepodge of
   repository locations from different revisions. But after testing, you
   know it's the precise combination of data you need to tag.

   Time to make a snapshot. Copying one URL to another won't work here. In
   this case, you want to make a snapshot of your exact working copy
   arrangement and store it in the repository. Luckily, svn copy actually
   has four different uses (which you can read about in Chapter 9,
   Subversion Complete Reference), including the ability to copy a working
   copy tree to the repository:
$ ls
my-working-copy/

$ svn copy my-working-copy \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/tags/mytag \
           -m "Tag my existing working copy state."

Committed revision 940.

   Now there is a new directory in the repository, /calc/tags/mytag, which
   is an exact snapshot of your working copyâmixed revisions, URLs, local
   changes, and all.

   Other users have found interesting uses for this feature. Sometimes
   there are situations where you have a bunch of local changes made to
   your working copy, and you'd like a collaborator to see them. Instead
   of running svn diff and sending a patch file (which won't capture
   directory, symlink, or property changes), you can use svn copy to
   âuploadâ your working copy to a private area of the repository. Your
   collaborator can then either check out a verbatim copy of your working
   copy or use svn merge to receive your exact changes.

   While this is a nice method for uploading a quick snapshot of your
   working copy, note that this is not a good way to initially create a
   branch. Branch creation should be an event unto itself, and this method
   conflates the creation of a branch with extra changes to files, all
   within a single revision. This makes it very difficult (later on) to
   identify a single revision number as a branch point.

Branch Maintenance

   You may have noticed by now that Subversion is extremely flexible.
   Because it implements branches and tags with the same underlying
   mechanism (directory copies), and because branches and tags appear in
   normal filesystem space, many people find Subversion intimidating. It's
   almost too flexible. In this section, we'll offer some suggestions for
   arranging and managing your data over time.

Repository Layout

   There are some standard, recommended ways to organize a repository.
   Most people create a trunk directory to hold the âmain lineâ of
   development, a branches directory to contain branch copies, and a tags
   directory to contain tag copies. If a repository holds only one
   project, often people create these top-level directories:
/trunk
/branches
/tags

   If a repository contains multiple projects, admins typically index
   their layout by project (see the section called âPlanning Your
   Repository Organizationâ to read more about âproject rootsâ):
/paint/trunk
/paint/branches
/paint/tags
/calc/trunk
/calc/branches
/calc/tags

   Of course, you're free to ignore these common layouts. You can create
   any sort of variation, whatever works best for you or your team.
   Remember that whatever you choose, it's not a permanent commitment. You
   can reorganize your repository at any time. Because branches and tags
   are ordinary directories, the svn move command can move or rename them
   however you wish. Switching from one layout to another is just a matter
   of issuing a series of server-side moves; if you don't like the way
   things are organized in the repository, just juggle the directories
   around.

   Remember, though, that while moving directories may be easy to do, you
   need to be considerate of your users as well. Your juggling can be
   disorienting to users with existing working copies. If a user has a
   working copy of a particular repository directory, your svn move
   operation might remove the path from the latest revision. When the user
   next runs svn update, she will be told that her working copy represents
   a path that no longer exists, and the user will be forced to svn switch
   to the new location.

Data Lifetimes

   Another nice feature of Subversion's model is that branches and tags
   can have finite lifetimes, just like any other versioned item. For
   example, suppose you eventually finish all your work on your personal
   branch of the calc project. After merging all of your changes back into
   /calc/trunk, there's no need for your private branch directory to stick
   around anymore:
$ svn delete http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
             -m "Removing obsolete branch of calc project."

Committed revision 375.

   And now your branch is gone. Of course, it's not really gone: the
   directory is simply missing from the HEAD revision, no longer
   distracting anyone. If you use svn checkout, svn switch, or svn list to
   examine an earlier revision, you'll still be able to see your old
   branch.

   If browsing your deleted directory isn't enough, you can always bring
   it back. Resurrecting data is very easy in Subversion. If there's a
   deleted directory (or file) that you'd like to bring back into HEAD,
   simply use svn copy to copy it from the old revision:
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch@374 \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
           -m "Restore my-calc-branch."

Committed revision 376.

   In our example, your personal branch had a relatively short lifetime:
   you may have created it to fix a bug or implement a new feature. When
   your task is done, so is the branch. In software development, though,
   it's also common to have two âmainâ branches running side by side for
   very long periods. For example, suppose it's time to release a stable
   version of the calc project to the public, and you know it's going to
   take a couple of months to shake bugs out of the software. You don't
   want people to add new features to the project, but you don't want to
   tell all developers to stop programming either. So instead, you create
   a âstableâ branch of the software that won't change much:
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/stable-1.0 \
           -m "Creating stable branch of calc project."

Committed revision 377.

   And now developers are free to continue adding cutting-edge (or
   experimental) features to /calc/trunk, and you can declare a project
   policy that only bug fixes are to be committed to
   /calc/branches/stable-1.0. That is, as people continue to work on the
   trunk, a human selectively ports bug fixes over to the stable branch.
   Even after the stable branch has shipped, you'll probably continue to
   maintain the branch for a long timeâthat is, as long as you continue to
   support that release for customers. We'll discuss this more in the next
   section.

Common Branching Patterns

   There are many different uses for branching and svn merge, and this
   section describes the most common.

   Version control is most often used for software development, so here's
   a quick peek at two of the most common branching/merging patterns used
   by teams of programmers. If you're not using Subversion for software
   development, feel free to skip this section. If you're a software
   developer using version control for the first time, pay close
   attention, as these patterns are often considered best practices by
   experienced folk. These processes aren't specific to Subversion;
   they're applicable to any version control system. Still, it may help to
   see them described in Subversion terms.

Release Branches

   Most software has a typical life cycle: code, test, release, repeat.
   There are two problems with this process. First, developers need to
   keep writing new features while quality assurance teams take time to
   test supposedly stable versions of the software. New work cannot halt
   while the software is tested. Second, the team almost always needs to
   support older, released versions of software; if a bug is discovered in
   the latest code, it most likely exists in released versions as well,
   and customers will want to get that bug fix without having to wait for
   a major new release.

   Here's where version control can help. The typical procedure looks like
   this:
    1. Developers commit all new work to the trunk. Day-to-day changes are
       committed to /trunk: new features, bug fixes, and so on.
    2. The trunk is copied to a âreleaseâ branch. When the team thinks the
       software is ready for release (say, a 1.0 release), /trunk might be
       copied to /branches/1.0.
    3. Teams continue to work in parallel. One team begins rigorous
       testing of the release branch, while another team continues new
       work (say, for version 2.0) on /trunk. If bugs are discovered in
       either location, fixes are ported back and forth as necessary. At
       some point, however, even that process stops. The branch is
       âfrozenâ for final testing right before a release.
    4. The branch is tagged and released. When testing is complete,
       /branches/1.0 is copied to /tags/1.0.0 as a reference snapshot. The
       tag is packaged and released to customers.
    5. The branch is maintained over time. While work continues on /trunk
       for version 2.0, bug fixes continue to be ported from /trunk to
       /branches/1.0. When enough bug fixes have accumulated, management
       may decide to do a 1.0.1 release: /branches/1.0 is copied to
       /tags/1.0.1, and the tag is packaged and released.

   This entire process repeats as the software matures: when the 2.0 work
   is complete, a new 2.0 release branch is created, tested, tagged, and
   eventually released. After some years, the repository ends up with a
   number of release branches in âmaintenanceâ mode, and a number of tags
   representing final shipped versions.

Feature Branches

   A feature branch is the sort of branch that's been the dominant example
   in this chapter (the one you've been working on while Sally continues
   to work on /trunk). It's a temporary branch created to work on a
   complex change without interfering with the stability of /trunk. Unlike
   release branches (which may need to be supported forever), feature
   branches are born, used for a while, merged back to the trunk, and then
   ultimately deleted. They have a finite span of usefulness.

   Again, project policies vary widely concerning exactly when it's
   appropriate to create a feature branch. Some projects never use feature
   branches at all: commits to /trunk are a free-for-all. The advantage to
   this system is that it's simpleânobody needs to learn about branching
   or merging. The disadvantage is that the trunk code is often unstable
   or unusable. Other projects use branches to an extreme: no change is
   ever committed to the trunk directly. Even the most trivial changes are
   created on a short-lived branch, carefully reviewed, and merged to the
   trunk. Then the branch is deleted. This system guarantees an
   exceptionally stable and usable trunk at all times, but at the cost of
   tremendous process overhead.

   Most projects take a middle-of-the-road approach. They commonly insist
   that /trunk compile and pass regression tests at all times. A feature
   branch is required only when a change requires a large number of
   destabilizing commits. A good rule of thumb is to ask this question: if
   the developer worked for days in isolation and then committed the large
   change all at once (so that /trunk were never destabilized), would it
   be too large a change to review? If the answer to that question is
   âyes,â the change should be developed on a feature branch. As the
   developer commits incremental changes to the branch, they can be easily
   reviewed by peers.

   Finally, there's the issue of how to best keep a feature branch in
   âsyncâ with the trunk as work progresses. As we mentioned earlier,
   there's a great risk to working on a branch for weeks or months; trunk
   changes may continue to pour in, to the point where the two lines of
   development differ so greatly that it may become a nightmare trying to
   merge the branch back to the trunk.

   This situation is best avoided by regularly merging trunk changes to
   the branch. Make up a policy: once a week, merge the last week's worth
   of trunk changes to the branch.

   At some point, you'll be ready to merge the âsynchronizedâ feature
   branch back to the trunk. To do this, begin by doing a final merge of
   the latest trunk changes to the branch. When that's done, the latest
   versions of branch and trunk will be absolutely identical except for
   your branch changes. You would then merge back with the --reintegrate
   option:
$ cd trunk-working-copy

$ svn update
At revision 1910.

$ svn merge --reintegrate http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/mybranch
--- Merging differences between repository URLs into '.':
U    real.c
U    integer.c
A    newdirectory
A    newdirectory/newfile
 U   .
â¦

   Another way of thinking about this pattern is that your weekly sync of
   trunk to branch is analogous to running svn update in a working copy,
   while the final merge step is analogous to running svn commit from a
   working copy. After all, what else is a working copy but a very shallow
   private branch? It's a branch that's capable of storing only one change
   at a time.

Vendor Branches

   As is especially the case when developing software, the data that you
   maintain under version control is often closely related to, or perhaps
   dependent upon, someone else's data. Generally, the needs of your
   project will dictate that you stay as up to date as possible with the
   data provided by that external entity without sacrificing the stability
   of your own project. This scenario plays itself out all the
   timeâanywhere that the information generated by one group of people has
   a direct effect on that which is generated by another group.

   For example, software developers might be working on an application
   that makes use of a third-party library. Subversion has just such a
   relationship with the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library (see the
   section called âThe Apache Portable Runtime Libraryâ). The Subversion
   source code depends on the APR library for all its portability needs.
   In earlier stages of Subversion's development, the project closely
   tracked APR's changing API, always sticking to the âbleeding edgeâ of
   the library's code churn. Now that both APR and Subversion have
   matured, Subversion attempts to synchronize with APR's library API only
   at well-tested, stable release points.

   Now, if your project depends on someone else's information, you could
   attempt to synchronize that information with your own in several ways.
   Most painfully, you could issue oral or written instructions to all the
   contributors of your project, telling them to make sure they have the
   specific versions of that third-party information that your project
   needs. If the third-party information is maintained in a Subversion
   repository, you could also use Subversion's externals definitions to
   effectively âpin downâ specific versions of that information to some
   location in your own working copy directory (see the section called
   âExternals Definitionsâ).

   But sometimes you want to maintain custom modifications to third-party
   code in your own version control system. Returning to the software
   development example, programmers might need to make modifications to
   that third-party library for their own purposes. These modifications
   might include new functionality or bug fixes, maintained internally
   only until they become part of an official release of the third-party
   library. Or the changes might never be relayed back to the library
   maintainers, existing solely as custom tweaks to make the library
   further suit the needs of the software developers.

   Now you face an interesting situation. Your project could house its
   custom modifications to the third-party data in some disjointed
   fashion, such as using patch files or full-fledged alternative versions
   of files and directories. But these quickly become maintenance
   headaches, requiring some mechanism by which to apply your custom
   changes to the third-party code and necessitating regeneration of those
   changes with each successive version of the third-party code that you
   track.

   The solution to this problem is to use vendor branches. A vendor branch
   is a directory tree in your own version control system that contains
   information provided by a third-party entity, or vendor. Each version
   of the vendor's data that you decide to absorb into your project is
   called a vendor drop.

   Vendor branches provide two benefits. First, by storing the currently
   supported vendor drop in your own version control system, you ensure
   that the members of your project never need to question whether they
   have the right version of the vendor's data. They simply receive that
   correct version as part of their regular working copy updates. Second,
   because the data lives in your own Subversion repository, you can store
   your custom changes to it in-placeâyou have no more need of an
   automated (or worse, manual) method for swapping in your
   customizations.

General Vendor Branch Management Procedure

   Managing vendor branches generally works like this: first, you create a
   top-level directory (such as /vendor) to hold the vendor branches. Then
   you import the third-party code into a subdirectory of that top-level
   directory. You then copy that subdirectory into your main development
   branch (e.g., /trunk) at the appropriate location. You always make your
   local changes in the main development branch. With each new release of
   the code you are tracking, you bring it into the vendor branch and
   merge the changes into /trunk, resolving whatever conflicts occur
   between your local changes and the upstream changes.

   An example will help to clarify this algorithm. We'll use a scenario
   where your development team is creating a calculator program that links
   against a third-party complex number arithmetic library, libcomplex.
   We'll begin with the initial creation of the vendor branch and the
   import of the first vendor drop. We'll call our vendor branch directory
   libcomplex, and our code drops will go into a subdirectory of our
   vendor branch called current. And since svn import creates all the
   intermediate parent directories it needs, we can actually accomplish
   both of these steps with a single command:
$ svn import /path/to/libcomplex-1.0 \
             http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/current \
             -m 'importing initial 1.0 vendor drop'
â¦

   We now have the current version of the libcomplex source code in
   /vendor/libcomplex/current. Now, we tag that version (see the section
   called âTagsâ) and then copy it into the main development branch. Our
   copy will create a new directory called libcomplex in our existing calc
   project directory. It is in this copied version of the vendor data that
   we will make our customizations:
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/current  \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/1.0      \
           -m 'tagging libcomplex-1.0'
â¦
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/1.0  \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/libcomplex        \
           -m 'bringing libcomplex-1.0 into the main branch'
â¦

   We check out our project's main branchâwhich now includes a copy of the
   first vendor dropâand we get to work customizing the libcomplex code.
   Before we know it, our modified version of libcomplex is now completely
   integrated into our calculator program. ^[25]

   A few weeks later, the developers of libcomplex release a new version
   of their libraryâversion 1.1âwhich contains some features and
   functionality that we really want. We'd like to upgrade to this new
   version, but without losing the customizations we made to the existing
   version. What we essentially would like to do is to replace our current
   baseline version of libcomplex 1.0 with a copy of libcomplex 1.1, and
   then re-apply the custom modifications we previously made to that
   library to the new version. But we actually approach the problem from
   the other direction, applying the changes made to libcomplex between
   versions 1.0 and 1.1 to our modified copy of it.

   To perform this upgrade, we check out a copy of our vendor branch and
   replace the code in the current directory with the new libcomplex 1.1
   source code. We quite literally copy new files on top of existing
   files, perhaps exploding the libcomplex 1.1 release tarball atop our
   existing files and directories. The goal here is to make our current
   directory contain only the libcomplex 1.1 code and to ensure that all
   that code is under version control. Oh, and we want to do this with as
   little version control history disturbance as possible.

   After replacing the 1.0 code with 1.1 code, svn status will show files
   with local modifications as well as, perhaps, some unversioned files.
   If we did what we were supposed to do, the unversioned files are only
   those new files introduced in the 1.1 release of libcomplexâwe run svn
   add on those to get them under version control. If the 1.1 code no
   longer has certain files that were in the 1.0 tree, it may be hard to
   notice them; you'd have to compare the two trees with some external
   tool and then svn delete any files present in 1.0 but not in 1.1.
   (Although it might also be just fine to let these same files live on in
   unused obscurity!) Finally, once our current working copy contains only
   the libcomplex 1.1 code, we commit the changes we made to get it
   looking that way.

   Our current branch now contains the new vendor drop. We tag the new
   version as 1.1 (in the same way we previously tagged the version 1.0
   vendor drop), and then merge the differences between the tag of the
   previous version and the new current version into our main development
   branch:
$ cd working-copies/calc
$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/1.0      \
            http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/current  \
            libcomplex
â¦ # resolve all the conflicts between their changes and our changes
$ svn commit -m 'merging libcomplex-1.1 into the main branch'
â¦

   In the trivial use case, the new version of our third-party tool would
   look, from a files-and-directories point of view, just like the
   previous version. None of the libcomplex source files would have been
   deleted, renamed, or moved to different locationsâthe new version would
   contain only textual modifications against the previous one. In a
   perfect world, our modifications would apply cleanly to the new version
   of the library, with absolutely no complications or conflicts.

   But things aren't always that simple, and in fact it is quite common
   for source files to get moved around between releases of software. This
   complicates the process of ensuring that our modifications are still
   valid for the new version of code, and things can quickly degrade into
   a situation where we have to manually re-create our customizations in
   the new version. Once Subversion knows about the history of a given
   source fileâincluding all its previous locationsâthe process of merging
   in the new version of the library is pretty simple. But we are
   responsible for telling Subversion how the source file layout changed
   from vendor drop to vendor drop.

svn_load_dirs.pl

   Vendor drops that contain more than a few deletes, additions, and moves
   complicate the process of upgrading to each successive version of the
   third-party data. So Subversion supplies the svn_load_dirs.pl script to
   assist with this process. This script automates the importing steps we
   mentioned in the general vendor branch management procedure to make
   sure mistakes are minimized. You will still be responsible for using
   the merge commands to merge the new versions of the third-party data
   into your main development branch, but svn_load_dirs.pl can help you
   more quickly and easily arrive at that stage.

   In short, svn_load_dirs.pl is an enhancement to svn import that has
   several important characteristics:
     * It can be run at any point in time to bring an existing directory
       in the repository to exactly match an external directory,
       performing all the necessary adds and deletes, and optionally
       performing moves, too.
     * It takes care of complicated series of operations between which
       Subversion requires an intermediate commitâsuch as before renaming
       a file or directory twice.
     * It will optionally tag the newly imported directory.
     * It will optionally add arbitrary properties to files and
       directories that match a regular expression.

   svn_load_dirs.pl takes three mandatory arguments. The first argument is
   the URL to the base Subversion directory to work in. This argument is
   followed by the URLârelative to the first argumentâinto which the
   current vendor drop will be imported. Finally, the third argument is
   the local directory to import. Using our previous example, a typical
   run of svn_load_dirs.pl might look like this:
$ svn_load_dirs.pl http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex \
                   current                                        \
                   /path/to/libcomplex-1.1
â¦

   You can indicate that you'd like svn_load_dirs.pl to tag the new vendor
   drop by passing the -t command-line option and specifying a tag name.
   This tag is another URL relative to the first program argument.
$ svn_load_dirs.pl -t libcomplex-1.1                              \
                   http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex \
                   current                                        \
                   /path/to/libcomplex-1.1
â¦

   When you run svn_load_dirs.pl, it examines the contents of your
   existing âcurrentâ vendor drop and compares them with the proposed new
   vendor drop. In the trivial case, no files will be in one version and
   not the other, and the script will perform the new import without
   incident. If, however, there are discrepancies in the file layouts
   between versions, svn_load_dirs.pl will ask you how to resolve those
   differences. For example, you will have the opportunity to tell the
   script that you know that the file math.c in version 1.0 of libcomplex
   was renamed to arithmetic.c in libcomplex 1.1. Any discrepancies not
   explained by moves are treated as regular additions and deletions.

   The script also accepts a separate configuration file for setting
   properties on files and directories matching a regular expression that
   are added to the repository. This configuration file is specified to
   svn_load_dirs.pl using the -p command-line option. Each line of the
   configuration file is a whitespace-delimited set of two or four values:
   a Perl-style regular expression against which to match the added path,
   a control keyword (either break or cont), and then optionally a
   property name and value.
\.png$              break   svn:mime-type   image/png
\.jpe?g$            break   svn:mime-type   image/jpeg
\.m3u$              cont    svn:mime-type   audio/x-mpegurl
\.m3u$              break   svn:eol-style   LF
.*                  break   svn:eol-style   native

   For each added path, the configured property changes whose regular
   expression matches the path are applied in order, unless the control
   specification is break (which means that no more property changes
   should be applied to that path). If the control specification is
   contâan abbreviation for continueâmatching will continue with the next
   line of the configuration file.

   Any whitespace in the regular expression, property name, or property
   value must be surrounded by either single or double quotes. You can
   escape quotes that are not used for wrapping whitespace by preceding
   them with a backslash (\) character. The backslash escapes only quotes
   when parsing the configuration file, so do not protect any other
   characters beyond what is necessary for the regular expression.

Summary

   We covered a lot of ground in this chapter. We discussed the concepts
   of tags and branches and demonstrated how Subversion implements these
   concepts by copying directories with the svn copy command. We showed
   how to use svn merge to copy changes from one branch to another or roll
   back bad changes. We went over the use of svn switch to create
   mixed-location working copies. And we talked about how one might manage
   the organization and lifetimes of branches in a repository.

   Remember the Subversion mantra: branches and tags are cheap. So don't
   be afraid to use them when needed!

   As a helpful reminder of all the operations we discussed, here is handy
   reference table you can consult as you begin to make use of branches.

   ^[20] Subversion does not support copying between different
   repositories. When using URLs with svn copy or svn move, you can only
   copy items within the same repository.

   ^[21] The Subversion project has plans, however, to someday implement a
   command that would accomplish the task of permanently deleting
   information. In the meantime, see the section called âsvndumpfilterâ
   for a possible workaround.

   ^[22] At least, this is true in Subversion 1.5 at the time of this
   writing. This behavior may improve in future versions of Subversion.

   ^[23] Interestingly, after rolling back a revision like this, we
   wouldn't be able to reapply the revision using svn merge . -c 5, since
   the mergeinfo would already list r5 as being applied. We would have to
   use the --ignore-ancestry option to make the merge command ignore the
   existing mergeinfo!

   ^[24] You can, however, use svn switch with the --relocate option if
   the URL of your server changes and you don't want to abandon an
   existing working copy. See svn switch for more information and an
   example.

   ^[25] And is entirely bug-free, of course!

   Summary

   The Subversion repository is the central storehouse of all your
   versioned data. As such, it becomes an obvious candidate for all the
   love and attention an administrator can offer. While the repository is
   generally a low-maintenance item, it is important to understand how to
   properly configure and care for it so that potential problems are
   avoided, and so actual problems are safely resolved.

   In this chapter, we'll discuss how to create and configure a Subversion
   repository. We'll also talk about repository maintenance, providing
   examples of how and when to use the svnlook and svnadmin tools provided
   with Subversion. We'll address some common questions and mistakes and
   give some suggestions on how to arrange the data in the repository.

   If you plan to access a Subversion repository only in the role of a
   user whose data is under version control (i.e., via a Subversion
   client), you can skip this chapter altogether. However, if you are, or
   wish to become, a Subversion repository administrator, ^[26] this
   chapter is for you.

The Subversion Repository, Defined

   Before jumping into the broader topic of repository administration,
   let's further define what a repository is. How does it look? How does
   it feel? Does it take its tea hot or iced, sweetened, and with lemon?
   As an administrator, you'll be expected to understand the composition
   of a repository both from a literal, OS-level perspectiveâhow a
   repository looks and acts with respect to non-Subversion toolsâand from
   a logical perspectiveâdealing with how data is represented inside the
   repository.

   Seen through the eyes of a typical file browser application (such as
   Windows Explorer) or command-line based filesystem navigation tools,
   the Subversion repository is just another directory full of stuff.
   There are some subdirectories with human-readable configuration files
   in them, some subdirectories with some not-so-human-readable data
   files, and so on. As in other areas of the Subversion design,
   modularity is given high regard, and hierarchical organization is
   preferred to cluttered chaos. So a shallow glance into a typical
   repository from a nuts-and-bolts perspective is sufficient to reveal
   the basic components of the repository:
$ ls repos
conf/  dav/  db/  format  hooks/  locks/  README.txt

   Here's a quick fly-by overview of what exactly you're seeing in this
   directory listing. (Don't get bogged down in the terminologyâdetailed
   coverage of these components exists elsewhere in this and other
   chapters.)

   conf
          A directory containing configuration files

   dav
          A directory provided to mod_dav_svn for its private housekeeping
          data

   db
          The data store for all of your versioned data

   format
          A file that contains a single integer that indicates the version
          number of the repository layout

   hooks
          A directory full of hook script templates (and hook scripts
          themselves, once you've installed some)

   locks
          A directory for Subversion's repository lock files, used for
          tracking accessors to the repository

   README.txt
          A file whose contents merely inform its readers that they are
          looking at a Subversion repository

   Of course, when accessed via the Subversion libraries, this otherwise
   unremarkable collection of files and directories suddenly becomes an
   implementation of a virtual, versioned filesystem, complete with
   customizable event triggers. This filesystem has its own notions of
   directories and files, very similar to the notions of such things held
   by real filesystems (such as NTFS, FAT32, ext3, etc.). But this is a
   special filesystemâit hangs these directories and files from revisions,
   keeping all the changes you've ever made to them safely stored and
   forever accessible. This is where the entirety of your versioned data
   lives.

Strategies for Repository Deployment

   Due largely to the simplicity of the overall design of the Subversion
   repository and the technologies on which it relies, creating and
   configuring a repository are fairly straightforward tasks. There are a
   few preliminary decisions you'll want to make, but the actual work
   involved in any given setup of a Subversion repository is pretty basic,
   tending toward mindless repetition if you find yourself setting up
   multiples of these things.

   Some things you'll want to consider beforehand, though, are:
     * What data do you expect to live in your repository (or
       repositories), and how will that data be organized?
     * Where will your repository live, and how will it be accessed?
     * What types of access control and repository event reporting do you
       need?
     * Which of the available types of data store do you want to use?

   In this section, we'll try to help you answer those questions.

Planning Your Repository Organization

   While Subversion allows you to move around versioned files and
   directories without any loss of information, and even provides ways of
   moving whole sets of versioned history from one repository to another,
   doing so can greatly disrupt the workflow of those who access the
   repository often and come to expect things to be at certain locations.
   So before creating a new repository, try to peer into the future a bit;
   plan ahead before placing your data under version control. By
   conscientiously âlaying outâ your repository or repositories and their
   versioned contents ahead of time, you can prevent many future
   headaches.

   Let's assume that as repository administrator, you will be responsible
   for supporting the version control system for several projects. Your
   first decision is whether to use a single repository for multiple
   projects, or to give each project its own repository, or some
   compromise of these two.

   There are benefits to using a single repository for multiple projects,
   most obviously the lack of duplicated maintenance. A single repository
   means that there is one set of hook programs, one thing to routinely
   back up, one thing to dump and load if Subversion releases an
   incompatible new version, and so on. Also, you can move data between
   projects easily, without losing any historical versioning information.

   The downside of using a single repository is that different projects
   may have different requirements in terms of the repository event
   triggers, such as needing to send commit notification emails to
   different mailing lists, or having different definitions about what
   does and does not constitute a legitimate commit. These aren't
   insurmountable problems, of courseâit just means that all of your hook
   scripts have to be sensitive to the layout of your repository rather
   than assuming that the whole repository is associated with a single
   group of people. Also, remember that Subversion uses repository-global
   revision numbers. While those numbers don't have any particular magical
   powers, some folks still don't like the fact that even though no
   changes have been made to their project lately, the youngest revision
   number for the repository keeps climbing because other projects are
   actively adding new revisions. ^[27]

   A middle-ground approach can be taken, too. For example, projects can
   be grouped by how well they relate to each other. You might have a few
   repositories with a handful of projects in each repository. That way,
   projects that are likely to want to share data can do so easily, and as
   new revisions are added to the repository, at least the developers know
   that those new revisions are at least remotely related to everyone who
   uses that repository.

   After deciding how to organize your projects with respect to
   repositories, you'll probably want to think about directory hierarchies
   within the repositories themselves. Because Subversion uses regular
   directory copies for branching and tagging (see Chapter 4, Branching
   and Merging), the Subversion community recommends that you choose a
   repository location for each project rootâthe âtopmostâ directory that
   contains data related to that projectâand then create three
   subdirectories beneath that root: trunk, meaning the directory under
   which the main project development occurs; branches, which is a
   directory in which to create various named branches of the main
   development line; and tags, which is a collection of tree snapshots
   that are created, and perhaps destroyed, but never changed. ^[28]

   For example, your repository might look like this:
/
   calc/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   calendar/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   spreadsheet/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   â¦

   Note that it doesn't matter where in your repository each project root
   is. If you have only one project per repository, the logical place to
   put each project root is at the root of that project's respective
   repository. If you have multiple projects, you might want to arrange
   them in groups inside the repository, perhaps putting projects with
   similar goals or shared code in the same subdirectory, or maybe just
   grouping them alphabetically. Such an arrangement might look like this:
/
   utils/
      calc/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      calendar/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      â¦
   office/
      spreadsheet/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      â¦

   Lay out your repository in whatever way you see fit. Subversion does
   not expect or enforce a particular layoutâin its eyes, a directory is a
   directory is a directory. Ultimately, you should choose the repository
   arrangement that meets the needs of the people who work on the projects
   that live there.

   In the name of full disclosure, though, we'll mention another very
   common layout. In this layout, the trunk, tags, and branches
   directories live in the root directory of your repository, and your
   projects are in subdirectories beneath those, like so:
/
   trunk/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      â¦
   tags/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      â¦
   branches/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      â¦

   There's nothing particularly incorrect about such a layout, but it may
   or may not seem as intuitive for your users. Especially in large,
   multiproject situations with many users, those users may tend to be
   familiar with only one or two of the projects in the repository. But
   the projects-as-branch-siblings approach tends to deemphasize project
   individuality and focus on the entire set of projects as a single
   entity. That's a social issue, though. We like our originally suggested
   arrangement for purely practical reasonsâit's easier to ask about (or
   modify, or migrate elsewhere) the entire history of a single project
   when there's a single repository path that holds the entire
   historyâpast, present, tagged, and branchedâfor that project and that
   project alone.

Deciding Where and How to Host Your Repository

   Before creating your Subversion repository, an obvious question you'll
   need to answer is where the thing is going to live. This is strongly
   connected to myriad other questions involving how the repository will
   be accessed (via a Subversion server or directly), by whom (users
   behind your corporate firewall or the whole world out on the open
   Internet), what other services you'll be providing around Subversion
   (repository browsing interfaces, email-based commit notification,
   etc.), your data backup strategy, and so on.

   We cover server choice and configuration in Chapter 6, Server
   Configuration, but the point we'd like to briefly make here is simply
   that the answers to some of these other questions might have
   implications that force your hand when deciding where your repository
   will live. For example, certain deployment scenarios might require
   accessing the repository via a remote filesystem from multiple
   computers, in which case (as you'll read in the next section) your
   choice of a repository backend data store turns out not to be a choice
   at all because only one of the available backends will work in this
   scenario.

   Addressing each possible way to deploy Subversion is both impossible
   and outside the scope of this book. We simply encourage you to evaluate
   your options using these pages and other sources as your reference
   material and to plan ahead.

Choosing a Data Store

   As of version 1.1, Subversion provides two options for the type of
   underlying data storeâoften referred to as âthe backendâ or, somewhat
   confusingly, âthe (versioned) filesystemââthat each repository uses.
   One type of data store keeps everything in a Berkeley DB (or BDB)
   database environment; repositories that use this type are often
   referred to as being âBDB-backed.â The other type stores data in
   ordinary flat files, using a custom format. Subversion developers have
   adopted the habit of referring to this latter data storage mechanism as
   FSFS ^[29] âa versioned filesystem implementation that uses the native
   OS filesystem directlyârather than via a database library or some other
   abstraction layerâto store data.

   Table 5.1, âRepository data store comparisonâ gives a comparative
   overview of Berkeley DB and FSFS repositories.

   Table 5.1. Repository data store comparison
   Category Feature Berkeley DB FSFS
   Reliability Data integrity When properly deployed, extremely reliable;
   Berkeley DB 4.4 brings auto-recovery Older versions had some rarely
   demonstrated, but data-destroying bugs
   Sensitivity to interruptions Very; crashes and permission problems can
   leave the database âwedged,â requiring journaled recovery procedures
   Quite insensitive
   Accessibility Usable from a read-only mount No Yes
   Platform-independent storage No Yes
   Usable over network filesystems Generally, no Yes
   Group permissions handling Sensitive to user umask problems; best if
   accessed by only one user Works around umask problems
   Scalability Repository disk usage Larger (especially if logfiles aren't
   purged) Smaller
   Number of revision trees Database; no problems Some older native
   filesystems don't scale well with thousands of entries in a single
   directory
   Directories with many files Slower Faster
   Performance Checking out latest revision No meaningful difference No
   meaningful difference
   Large commits Slower overall, but cost is amortized across the lifetime
   of the commit Faster overall, but finalization delay may cause client
   timeouts

   There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these two backend
   types. Neither of them is more âofficialâ than the other, though the
   newer FSFS is the default data store as of Subversion 1.2. Both are
   reliable enough to trust with your versioned data. But as you can see
   in Table 5.1, âRepository data store comparisonâ, the FSFS backend
   provides quite a bit more flexibility in terms of its supported
   deployment scenarios. More flexibility means you have to work a little
   harder to find ways to deploy it incorrectly. Those reasonsâplus the
   fact that not using Berkeley DB means there's one fewer component in
   the systemâlargely explain why today almost everyone uses the FSFS
   backend when creating new repositories.

   Fortunately, most programs that access Subversion repositories are
   blissfully ignorant of which backend data store is in use. And you
   aren't even necessarily stuck with your first choice of a data storeâin
   the event that you change your mind later, Subversion provides ways of
   migrating your repository's data into another repository that uses a
   different backend data store. We talk more about that later in this
   chapter.

   The following subsections provide a more detailed look at the available
   backend data store types.

Berkeley DB

   When the initial design phase of Subversion was in progress, the
   developers decided to use Berkeley DB for a variety of reasons,
   including its open source license, transaction support, reliability,
   performance, API simplicity, thread safety, support for cursors, and so
   on.

   Berkeley DB provides real transaction supportâperhaps its most powerful
   feature. Multiple processes accessing your Subversion repositories
   don't have to worry about accidentally clobbering each other's data.
   The isolation provided by the transaction system is such that for any
   given operation, the Subversion repository code sees a static view of
   the databaseânot a database that is constantly changing at the hand of
   some other processâand can make decisions based on that view. If the
   decision made happens to conflict with what another process is doing,
   the entire operation is rolled back as though it never happened, and
   Subversion gracefully retries the operation against a new, updated (and
   yet still static) view of the database.

   Another great feature of Berkeley DB is hot backupsâthe ability to back
   up the database environment without taking it âoffline.â We'll discuss
   how to back up your repository later in this chapter (in the section
   called âRepository Backupâ), but the benefits of being able to make
   fully functional copies of your repositories without any downtime
   should be obvious.

   Berkeley DB is also a very reliable database system when properly used.
   Subversion uses Berkeley DB's logging facilities, which means that the
   database first writes to on-disk logfiles a description of any
   modifications it is about to make, and then makes the modification
   itself. This is to ensure that if anything goes wrong, the database
   system can back up to a previous checkpointâa location in the logfiles
   known not to be corruptâand replay transactions until the data is
   restored to a usable state. See the section called âManaging Disk
   Spaceâ later in this chapter for more about Berkeley DB logfiles.

   But every rose has its thorn, and so we must note some known
   limitations of Berkeley DB. First, Berkeley DB environments are not
   portable. You cannot simply copy a Subversion repository that was
   created on a Unix system onto a Windows system and expect it to work.
   While much of the Berkeley DB database format is
   architecture-independent, other aspects of the environment are not.
   Second, Subversion uses Berkeley DB in a way that will not operate on
   Windows 95/98 systemsâif you need to house a BDB-backed repository on a
   Windows machine, stick with Windows 2000 or later.

   While Berkeley DB promises to behave correctly on network shares that
   meet a particular set of specifications, ^[30] most networked
   filesystem types and appliances do not actually meet those
   requirements. And in no case can you allow a BDB-backed repository that
   resides on a network share to be accessed by multiple clients of that
   share at once (which quite often is the whole point of having the
   repository live on a network share in the first place).

Warning

   If you attempt to use Berkeley DB on a noncompliant remote filesystem,
   the results are unpredictableâyou may see mysterious errors right away,
   or it may be months before you discover that your repository database
   is subtly corrupted. You should strongly consider using the FSFS data
   store for repositories that need to live on a network share.

   Finally, because Berkeley DB is a library linked directly into
   Subversion, it's more sensitive to interruptions than a typical
   relational database system. Most SQL systems, for example, have a
   dedicated server process that mediates all access to tables. If a
   program accessing the database crashes for some reason, the database
   daemon notices the lost connection and cleans up any mess left behind.
   And because the database daemon is the only process accessing the
   tables, applications don't need to worry about permission conflicts.
   These things are not the case with Berkeley DB, however. Subversion
   (and programs using Subversion libraries) access the database tables
   directly, which means that a program crash can leave the database in a
   temporarily inconsistent, inaccessible state. When this happens, an
   administrator needs to ask Berkeley DB to restore to a checkpoint,
   which is a bit of an annoyance. Other things can cause a repository to
   âwedgeâ besides crashed processes, such as programs conflicting over
   ownership and permissions on the database files.

Note

   Berkeley DB 4.4 brings (to Subversion 1.4 and later) the ability for
   Subversion to automatically and transparently recover Berkeley DB
   environments in need of such recovery. When a Subversion process
   attaches to a repository's Berkeley DB environment, it uses some
   process accounting mechanisms to detect any unclean disconnections by
   previous processes, performs any necessary recovery, and then continues
   on as though nothing happened. This doesn't completely eliminate
   instances of repository wedging, but it does drastically reduce the
   amount of human interaction required to recover from them.

   So while a Berkeley DB repository is quite fast and scalable, it's best
   used by a single server process running as one userâsuch as Apache's
   httpd or svnserve (see Chapter 6, Server Configuration)ârather than
   accessing it as many different users via file:// or svn+ssh:// URLs. If
   you're accessing a Berkeley DB repository directly as multiple users,
   be sure to read the section called âSupporting Multiple Repository
   Access Methodsâ later in this chapter.

FSFS

   In mid-2004, a second type of repository storage systemâone that
   doesn't use a database at allâcame into being. An FSFS repository
   stores the changes associated with a revision in a single file, and so
   all of a repository's revisions can be found in a single subdirectory
   full of numbered files. Transactions are created in separate
   subdirectories as individual files. When complete, the transaction file
   is renamed and moved into the revisions directory, thus guaranteeing
   that commits are atomic. And because a revision file is permanent and
   unchanging, the repository also can be backed up while âhot,â just like
   a BDB-backed repository.

   The FSFS revision files describe a revision's directory structure, file
   contents, and deltas against files in other revision trees. Unlike a
   Berkeley DB database, this storage format is portable across different
   operating systems and isn't sensitive to CPU architecture. Because no
   journaling or shared-memory files are being used, the repository can be
   safely accessed over a network filesystem and examined in a read-only
   environment. The lack of database overhead also means the overall
   repository size is a bit smaller.

   FSFS has different performance characteristics, too. When committing a
   directory with a huge number of files, FSFS is able to more quickly
   append directory entries. On the other hand, FSFS writes the latest
   version of a file as a delta against an earlier version, which means
   that checking out the latest tree is a bit slower than fetching the
   full-texts stored in a Berkeley DB HEAD revision. FSFS also has a
   longer delay when finalizing a commit, which could in extreme cases
   cause clients to time out while waiting for a response.

   The most important distinction, however, is FSFS's imperviousness to
   wedging when something goes wrong. If a process using a Berkeley DB
   database runs into a permissions problem or suddenly crashes, the
   database can be left in an unusable state until an administrator
   recovers it. If the same scenarios happen to a process using an FSFS
   repository, the repository isn't affected at all. At worst, some
   transaction data is left behind.

   The only real argument against FSFS is its relative immaturity compared
   to Berkeley DB. Unlike Berkeley DB, which has years of history, its own
   dedicated development team, and, now, Oracle's mighty name attached to
   it, ^[31] FSFS is a newer bit of engineering. Prior to Subversion 1.4,
   it was still shaking out some pretty serious data integrity bugs,
   which, while triggered in only very rare cases, nonetheless did occur.
   That said, FSFS has quickly become the backend of choice for some of
   the largest public and private Subversion repositories, and it promises
   a lower barrier to entry for Subversion across the board.

Creating and Configuring Your Repository

   Earlier in this chapter (in the section called âStrategies for
   Repository Deploymentâ), we looked at some of the important decisions
   that should be made before creating and configuring your Subversion
   repository. Now, we finally get to get our hands dirty! In this
   section, we'll see how to actually create a Subversion repository and
   configure it to perform custom actions when special repository events
   occur.

Creating the Repository

   Subversion repository creation is an incredibly simple task. The
   svnadmin utility that comes with Subversion provides a subcommand
   (svnadmin create) for doing just that.
$ # Create a repository
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/repos
$

   This creates a new repository in the directory /var/svn/repos, and with
   the default filesystem data store. Prior to Subversion 1.2, the default
   was to use Berkeley DB; the default is now FSFS. You can explicitly
   choose the filesystem type using the --fs-type argument, which accepts
   as a parameter either fsfs or bdb.
$ # Create an FSFS-backed repository
$ svnadmin create --fs-type fsfs /var/svn/repos
$

# Create a Berkeley-DB-backed repository
$ svnadmin create --fs-type bdb /var/svn/repos
$

   After running this simple command, you have a Subversion repository.

Tip

   The path argument to svnadmin is just a regular filesystem path and not
   a URL like the svn client program uses when referring to repositories.
   Both svnadmin and svnlook are considered server-side utilitiesâthey are
   used on the machine where the repository resides to examine or modify
   aspects of the repository, and are in fact unable to perform tasks
   across a network. A common mistake made by Subversion newcomers is
   trying to pass URLs (even âlocalâ file:// ones) to these two programs.

   Present in the db/ subdirectory of your repository is the
   implementation of the versioned filesystem. Your new repository's
   versioned filesystem begins life at revision 0, which is defined to
   consist of nothing but the top-level root (/) directory. Initially,
   revision 0 also has a single revision property, svn:date, set to the
   time at which the repository was created.

   Now that you have a repository, it's time to customize it.

Warning

   While some parts of a Subversion repositoryâsuch as the configuration
   files and hook scriptsâare meant to be examined and modified manually,
   you shouldn't (and shouldn't need to) tamper with the other parts of
   the repository âby hand.â The svnadmin tool should be sufficient for
   any changes necessary to your repository, or you can look to
   third-party tools (such as Berkeley DB's tool suite) for tweaking
   relevant subsections of the repository. Do not attempt manual
   manipulation of your version control history by poking and prodding
   around in your repository's data store files!

Implementing Repository Hooks

   A hook is a program triggered by some repository event, such as the
   creation of a new revision or the modification of an unversioned
   property. Some hooks (the so-called âpre hooksâ) run in advance of a
   repository operation and provide a means by which to both report what
   is about to happen and prevent it from happening at all. Other hooks
   (the âpost hooksâ) run after the completion of a repository event and
   are useful for performing tasks that examineâbut don't modifyâthe
   repository. Each hook is handed enough information to tell what that
   event is (or was), the specific repository changes proposed (or
   completed), and the username of the person who triggered the event.

   The hooks subdirectory is, by default, filled with templates for
   various repository hooks:
$ ls repos/hooks/
post-commit.tmpl          post-unlock.tmpl  pre-revprop-change.tmpl
post-lock.tmpl            pre-commit.tmpl   pre-unlock.tmpl
post-revprop-change.tmpl  pre-lock.tmpl     start-commit.tmpl
$

   There is one template for each hook that the Subversion repository
   supports; by examining the contents of those template scripts, you can
   see what triggers each script to run and what data is passed to that
   script. Also present in many of these templates are examples of how one
   might use that script, in conjunction with other Subversion-supplied
   programs, to perform common useful tasks. To actually install a working
   hook, you need only place some executable program or script into the
   repos/hooks directory, which can be executed as the name (such as
   start-commit or post-commit) of the hook.

   On Unix platforms, this means supplying a script or program (which
   could be a shell script, a Python program, a compiled C binary, or any
   number of other things) named exactly like the name of the hook. Of
   course, the template files are present for more than just informational
   purposesâthe easiest way to install a hook on Unix platforms is to
   simply copy the appropriate template file to a new file that lacks the
   .tmpl extension, customize the hook's contents, and ensure that the
   script is executable. Windows, however, uses file extensions to
   determine whether a program is executable, so you would need to supply
   a program whose basename is the name of the hook and whose extension is
   one of the special extensions recognized by Windows for executable
   programs, such as .exe for programs and .bat for batch files.

Tip

   For security reasons, the Subversion repository executes hook programs
   with an empty environmentâthat is, no environment variables are set at
   all, not even $PATH (or %PATH%, under Windows). Because of this, many
   administrators are baffled when their hook program runs fine by hand,
   but doesn't work when run by Subversion. Be sure to explicitly set any
   necessary environment variables in your hook program and/or use
   absolute paths to programs.

   Subversion executes hooks as the same user who owns the process that is
   accessing the Subversion repository. In most cases, the repository is
   being accessed via a Subversion server, so this user is the same user
   as whom the server runs on the system. The hooks themselves will need
   to be configured with OS-level permissions that allow that user to
   execute them. Also, this means that any programs or files (including
   the Subversion repository) accessed directly or indirectly by the hook
   will be accessed as the same user. In other words, be alert to
   potential permission-related problems that could prevent the hook from
   performing the tasks it is designed to perform.

   There are serveral hooks implemented by the Subversion repository, and
   you can get details about each of them in the section called
   âRepository Hooksâ. As a repository administrator, you'll need to
   decide which hooks you wish to implement (by way of providing an
   appropriately named and permissioned hook program), and how. When you
   make this decision, keep in mind the big picture of how your repository
   is deployed. For example, if you are using server configuration to
   determine which users are permitted to commit changes to your
   repository, you don't need to do this sort of access control via the
   hook system.

   There is no shortage of Subversion hook programs and scripts that are
   freely available either from the Subversion community itself or
   elsewhere. These scripts cover a wide range of utilityâbasic access
   control, policy adherence checking, issue tracker integration, email-
   or syndication-based commit notification, and beyond. Or, if you wish
   to write your own, see Chapter 8, Embedding Subversion.

Warning

   While hook scripts can do almost anything, there is one dimension in
   which hook script authors should show restraint: do not modify a commit
   transaction using hook scripts. While it might be tempting to use hook
   scripts to automatically correct errors, shortcomings, or policy
   violations present in the files being committed, doing so can cause
   problems. Subversion keeps client-side caches of certain bits of
   repository data, and if you change a commit transaction in this way,
   those caches become indetectably stale. This inconsistency can lead to
   surprising and unexpected behavior. Instead of modifying the
   transaction, you should simply validate the transaction in the
   pre-commit hook and reject the commit if it does not meet the desired
   requirements. As a bonus, your users will learn the value of careful,
   compliance-minded work habits.

Berkeley DB Configuration

   A Berkeley DB environment is an encapsulation of one or more databases,
   logfiles, region files, and configuration files. The Berkeley DB
   environment has its own set of default configuration values for things
   such as the number of database locks allowed to be taken out at any
   given time, the maximum size of the journaling logfiles, and so on.
   Subversion's filesystem logic additionally chooses default values for
   some of the Berkeley DB configuration options. However, sometimes your
   particular repository, with its unique collection of data and access
   patterns, might require a different set of configuration option values.

   The producers of Berkeley DB understand that different applications and
   database environments have different requirements, so they have
   provided a mechanism for overriding at runtime many of the
   configuration values for the Berkeley DB environment. BDB checks for
   the presence of a file named DB_CONFIG in the environment directory
   (namely, the repository's db subdirectory), and parses the options
   found in that file. Subversion itself creates this file when it creates
   the rest of the repository. The file initially contains some default
   options, as well as pointers to the Berkeley DB online documentation so
   that you can read about what those options do. Of course, you are free
   to add any of the supported Berkeley DB options to your DB_CONFIG file.
   Just be aware that while Subversion never attempts to read or interpret
   the contents of the file and makes no direct use of the option settings
   in it, you'll want to avoid any configuration changes that may cause
   Berkeley DB to behave in a fashion that is at odds with what Subversion
   might expect. Also, changes made to DB_CONFIG won't take effect until
   you recover the database environment (using svnadmin recover).

Repository Maintenance

   Maintaining a Subversion repository can be daunting, mostly due to the
   complexities inherent in systems that have a database backend. Doing
   the task well is all about knowing the toolsâwhat they are, when to use
   them, and how. This section will introduce you to the repository
   administration tools provided by Subversion and discuss how to wield
   them to accomplish tasks such as repository data migration, upgrades,
   backups, and cleanups.

An Administrator's Toolkit

   Subversion provides a handful of utilities useful for creating,
   inspecting, modifying, and repairing your repository. Let's look more
   closely at each of those tools. Afterward, we'll briefly examine some
   of the utilities included in the Berkeley DB distribution that provide
   functionality specific to your repository's database backend not
   otherwise provided by Subversion's own tools.

svnadmin

   The svnadmin program is the repository administrator's best friend.
   Besides providing the ability to create Subversion repositories, this
   program allows you to perform several maintenance operations on those
   repositories. The syntax of svnadmin is similar to that of other
   Subversion command-line programs:
$ svnadmin help
general usage: svnadmin SUBCOMMAND REPOS_PATH  [ARGS & OPTIONS ...]
Type 'svnadmin help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.
Type 'svnadmin --version' to see the program version and FS modules.

Available subcommands:
   crashtest
   create
   deltify
â¦

   Previously in this chapter (in the section called âCreating the
   Repositoryâ), we were introduced to the svnadmin create subcommand.
   Most of the other svnadmin subcommands we will cover later in this
   chapter. And you can consult the section called âsvnadminâ for a full
   rundown of subcommands and what each of them offers.

svnlook

   svnlook is a tool provided by Subversion for examining the various
   revisions and transactions (which are revisions in the making) in a
   repository. No part of this program attempts to change the repository.
   svnlook is typically used by the repository hooks for reporting the
   changes that are about to be committed (in the case of the pre-commit
   hook) or that were just committed (in the case of the post-commit hook)
   to the repository. A repository administrator may use this tool for
   diagnostic purposes.

   svnlook has a straightforward syntax:
$ svnlook help
general usage: svnlook SUBCOMMAND REPOS_PATH [ARGS & OPTIONS ...]
Note: any subcommand which takes the '--revision' and '--transaction'
      options will, if invoked without one of those options, act on
      the repository's youngest revision.
Type 'svnlook help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.
Type 'svnlook --version' to see the program version and FS modules.
â¦

   Most of svnlook's subcommands can operate on either a revision or a
   transaction tree, printing information about the tree itself, or how it
   differs from the previous revision of the repository. You use the
   --revision (-r) and --transaction (-t) options to specify which
   revision or transaction, respectively, to examine. In the absence of
   both the --revision (-r) and --transaction (-t) options, svnlook will
   examine the youngest (or HEAD) revision in the repository. So the
   following two commands do exactly the same thing when 19 is the
   youngest revision in the repository located at /var/svn/repos:
$ svnlook info /var/svn/repos
$ svnlook info /var/svn/repos -r 19

   One exception to these rules about subcommands is the svnlook youngest
   subcommand, which takes no options and simply prints out the
   repository's youngest revision number:
$ svnlook youngest /var/svn/repos
19
$

Note

   Keep in mind that the only transactions you can browse are uncommitted
   ones. Most repositories will have no such transactions because
   transactions are usually either committed (in which case, you should
   access them as revision with the --revision (-r) option) or aborted and
   removed.

   Output from svnlook is designed to be both human- and machine-parsable.
   Take, as an example, the output of the svnlook info subcommand:
$ svnlook info /var/svn/repos
sally
2002-11-04 09:29:13 -0600 (Mon, 04 Nov 2002)
27
Added the usual
Greek tree.
$

   The output of svnlook info consists of the following, in the order
   given:
    1. The author, followed by a newline
    2. The date, followed by a newline
    3. The number of characters in the log message, followed by a newline
    4. The log message itself, followed by a newline

   This output is human-readable, meaning items such as the datestamp are
   displayed using a textual representation instead of something more
   obscure (such as the number of nanoseconds since the Tastee Freez guy
   drove by). But the output is also machine-parsableâbecause the log
   message can contain multiple lines and be unbounded in length, svnlook
   provides the length of that message before the message itself. This
   allows scripts and other wrappers around this command to make
   intelligent decisions about the log message, such as how much memory to
   allocate for the message, or at least how many bytes to skip in the
   event that this output is not the last bit of data in the stream.

   svnlook can perform a variety of other queries: displaying subsets of
   bits of information we've mentioned previously, recursively listing
   versioned directory trees, reporting which paths were modified in a
   given revision or transaction, showing textual and property differences
   made to files and directories, and so on. See the section called
   âsvnlookâ for a full reference of svnlook's features.

svndumpfilter

   While it won't be the most commonly used tool at the administrator's
   disposal, svndumpfilter provides a very particular brand of useful
   functionalityâthe ability to quickly and easily modify streams of
   Subversion repository history data by acting as a path-based filter.

   The syntax of svndumpfilter is as follows:
$ svndumpfilter help
general usage: svndumpfilter SUBCOMMAND [ARGS & OPTIONS ...]
Type "svndumpfilter help <subcommand>" for help on a specific subcommand.
Type 'svndumpfilter --version' to see the program version.

Available subcommands:
   exclude
   include
   help (?, h)

   There are only two interesting subcommands: svndumpfilter exclude and
   svndumpfilter include. They allow you to make the choice between
   implicit or explicit inclusion of paths in the stream. You can learn
   more about these subcommands and svndumpfilter's unique purpose later
   in this chapter, in the section called âFiltering Repository Historyâ.

svnsync

   The svnsync program, which is new to the 1.4 release of Subversion,
   provides all the functionality required for maintaining a read-only
   mirror of a Subversion repository. The program really has one jobâto
   transfer one repository's versioned history into another repository.
   And while there are few ways to do that, its primary strength is that
   it can operate remotelyâthe âsourceâ and âsinkâ ^[32] repositories may
   be on different computers from each other and from svnsync itself.

   As you might expect, svnsync has a syntax that looks very much like
   every other program we've mentioned in this chapter:
$ svnsync help
general usage: svnsync SUBCOMMAND DEST_URL  [ARGS & OPTIONS ...]
Type 'svnsync help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.
Type 'svnsync --version' to see the program version and RA modules.

Available subcommands:
   initialize (init)
   synchronize (sync)
   copy-revprops
   help (?, h)
$

   We talk more about replicating repositories with svnsync later in this
   chapter (see the section called âRepository Replicationâ).

fsfs-reshard.py

   While not an official member of the Subversion toolchain, the
   fsfs-reshard.py script (found in the tools/server-side directory of the
   Subversion source distribution) is a useful performance tuning tool for
   administrators of FSFS-backed Subversion repositories. FSFS
   repositories contain files that describe the changes made in a single
   revision, and files that contain the revision properties associated
   with a single revision. Repositories created in versions of Subversion
   prior to 1.5 keep these files in two directoriesâone for each type of
   file. As new revisions are committed to the repository, Subversion
   drops more files into these two directoriesâover time, the number of
   these files in each directory can grow to be quite large. This has been
   observed to cause performance problems on certain network-based
   filesystems.

   Subversion 1.5 creates FSFS-backed repositories using a slightly
   modified layout in which the contents of these two directories are
   sharded, or scattered across several subdirectories. This can greatly
   reduce the time it takes the system to locate any one of these files,
   and therefore increases the overall performance of Subversion when
   reading from the repository. The number of subdirectories used to house
   these files is configurable, though, and that's where fsfs-reshard.py
   comes in. This script reshuffles the repository's file structure into a
   new arrangement that reflects the requested number of sharding
   subdirectories. This is especially useful for converting an older
   Subversion repository into the new Subversion 1.5 sharded layout (which
   Subversion will not automatically do for you) or for fine-tuning an
   already sharded repository.

Berkeley DB utilities

   If you're using a Berkeley DB repository, all of your versioned
   filesystem's structure and data live in a set of database tables within
   the db/ subdirectory of your repository. This subdirectory is a regular
   Berkeley DB environment directory and can therefore be used in
   conjunction with any of the Berkeley database tools, typically provided
   as part of the Berkeley DB distribution.

   For day-to-day Subversion use, these tools are unnecessary. Most of the
   functionality typically needed for Subversion repositories has been
   duplicated in the svnadmin tool. For example, svnadmin
   list-unused-dblogs and svnadmin list-dblogs perform a subset of what is
   provided by the Berkeley db_archive utility, and svnadmin recover
   reflects the common use cases of the db_recover utility.

   However, there are still a few Berkeley DB utilities that you might
   find useful. The db_dump and db_load programs write and read,
   respectively, a custom file format that describes the keys and values
   in a Berkeley DB database. Since Berkeley databases are not portable
   across machine architectures, this format is a useful way to transfer
   those databases from machine to machine, irrespective of architecture
   or operating system. As we describe later in this chapter, you can also
   use svnadmin dump and svnadmin load for similar purposes, but db_dump
   and db_load can do certain jobs just as well and much faster. They can
   also be useful if the experienced Berkeley DB hacker needs to do
   in-place tweaking of the data in a BDB-backed repository for some
   reason, which is something Subversion's utilities won't allow. Also,
   the db_stat utility can provide useful information about the status of
   your Berkeley DB environment, including detailed statistics about the
   locking and storage subsystems.

   For more information on the Berkeley DB tool chain, visit the
   documentation section of the Berkeley DB section of Oracle's web site,
   located at
   http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/.

Commit Log Message Correction

   Sometimes a user will have an error in her log message (a misspelling
   or some misinformation, perhaps). If the repository is configured
   (using the pre-revprop-change hook; see the section called
   âImplementing Repository Hooksâ) to accept changes to this log message
   after the commit is finished, the user can âfixâ her log message
   remotely using svn propset (see svn propset). However, because of the
   potential to lose information forever, Subversion repositories are not,
   by default, configured to allow changes to unversioned
   propertiesâexcept by an administrator.

   If a log message needs to be changed by an administrator, this can be
   done using svnadmin setlog. This command changes the log message (the
   svn:log property) on a given revision of a repository, reading the new
   value from a provided file.
$ echo "Here is the new, correct log message" > newlog.txt
$ svnadmin setlog myrepos newlog.txt -r 388

   The svnadmin setlog command, by default, is still bound by the same
   protections against modifying unversioned properties as a remote client
   isâthe pre- and post-revprop-change hooks are still triggered, and
   therefore must be set up to accept changes of this nature. But an
   administrator can get around these protections by passing the
   --bypass-hooks option to the svnadmin setlog command.

Warning

   Remember, though, that by bypassing the hooks, you are likely avoiding
   such things as email notifications of property changes, backup systems
   that track unversioned property changes, and so on. In other words, be
   very careful about what you are changing, and how you change it.

Managing Disk Space

   While the cost of storage has dropped incredibly in the past few years,
   disk usage is still a valid concern for administrators seeking to
   version large amounts of data. Every bit of version history information
   stored in the live repository needs to be backed up elsewhere, perhaps
   multiple times as part of rotating backup schedules. It is useful to
   know what pieces of Subversion's repository data need to remain on the
   live site, which need to be backed up, and which can be safely removed.

How Subversion saves disk space

   To keep the repository small, Subversion uses deltification (or
   deltified storage) within the repository itself. Deltification involves
   encoding the representation of a chunk of data as a collection of
   differences against some other chunk of data. If the two pieces of data
   are very similar, this deltification results in storage savings for the
   deltified chunkârather than taking up space equal to the size of the
   original data, it takes up only enough space to say, âI look just like
   this other piece of data over here, except for the following couple of
   changes.â The result is that most of the repository data that tends to
   be bulkyânamely, the contents of versioned filesâis stored at a much
   smaller size than the original full-text representation of that data.
   And for repositories created with Subversion 1.4 or later, the space
   savings are even betterânow those full-text representations of file
   contents are themselves compressed.

Note

   Because all of the data that is subject to deltification in a
   BDB-backed repository is stored in a single Berkeley DB database file,
   reducing the size of the stored values will not immediately reduce the
   size of the database file itself. Berkeley DB will, however, keep
   internal records of unused areas of the database file and consume those
   areas first before growing the size of the database file. So while
   deltification doesn't produce immediate space savings, it can
   drastically slow future growth of the database.

Removing dead transactions

   Though they are uncommon, there are circumstances in which a Subversion
   commit process might fail, leaving behind in the repository the
   remnants of the revision-to-be that wasn'tâan uncommitted transaction
   and all the file and directory changes associated with it. This could
   happen for several reasons: perhaps the client operation was
   inelegantly terminated by the user, or a network failure occurred in
   the middle of an operation. Regardless of the reason, dead transactions
   can happen. They don't do any real harm, other than consuming disk
   space. A fastidious administrator may nonetheless wish to remove them.

   You can use the svnadmin lstxns command to list the names of the
   currently outstanding transactions:
$ svnadmin lstxns myrepos
19
3a1
a45
$

   Each item in the resultant output can then be used with svnlook (and
   its --transaction (-t) option) to determine who created the
   transaction, when it was created, what types of changes were made in
   the transactionâinformation that is helpful in determining whether the
   transaction is a safe candidate for removal! If you do indeed want to
   remove a transaction, its name can be passed to svnadmin rmtxns, which
   will perform the cleanup of the transaction. In fact, svnadmin rmtxns
   can take its input directly from the output of svnadmin lstxns!
$ svnadmin rmtxns myrepos `svnadmin lstxns myrepos`
$

   If you use these two subcommands like this, you should consider making
   your repository temporarily inaccessible to clients. That way, no one
   can begin a legitimate transaction before you start your cleanup.
   Example 5.1, âtxn-info.sh (reporting outstanding transactions)â
   contains a bit of shell-scripting that can quickly generate information
   about each outstanding transaction in your repository.

   Example 5.1. txn-info.sh (reporting outstanding transactions)
#!/bin/sh

### Generate informational output for all outstanding transactions in
### a Subversion repository.

REPOS="${1}"
if [ "x$REPOS" = x ] ; then
  echo "usage: $0 REPOS_PATH"
  exit
fi

for TXN in `svnadmin lstxns ${REPOS}`; do
  echo "---[ Transaction ${TXN} ]-------------------------------------------"
  svnlook info "${REPOS}" -t "${TXN}"
done

   The output of the script is basically a concatenation of several chunks
   of svnlook info output (see the section called âsvnlookâ) and will look
   something like this:
$ txn-info.sh myrepos
---[ Transaction 19 ]-------------------------------------------
sally
2001-09-04 11:57:19 -0500 (Tue, 04 Sep 2001)

---[ Transaction 3a1 ]-------------------------------------------
harry
2001-09-10 16:50:30 -0500 (Mon, 10 Sep 2001)

---[ Transaction a45 ]-------------------------------------------
sally
2001-09-12 11:09:28 -0500 (Wed, 12 Sep 2001)

$

   A long-abandoned transaction usually represents some sort of failed or
   interrupted commit. A transaction's datestamp can provide interesting
   informationâfor example, how likely is it that an operation begun nine
   months ago is still active?

   In short, transaction cleanup decisions need not be made unwisely.
   Various sources of informationâincluding Apache's error and access
   logs, Subversion's operational logs, Subversion revision history, and
   so onâcan be employed in the decision-making process. And of course, an
   administrator can often simply communicate with a seemingly dead
   transaction's owner (via email, e.g.) to verify that the transaction
   is, in fact, in a zombie state.

Purging unused Berkeley DB logfiles

   Until recently, the largest offender of disk space usage with respect
   to BDB-backed Subversion repositories were the logfiles in which
   Berkeley DB performs its prewrites before modifying the actual database
   files. These files capture all the actions taken along the route of
   changing the database from one state to anotherâwhile the database
   files, at any given time, reflect a particular state, the logfiles
   contain all of the many changes along the way between states. Thus,
   they can grow and accumulate quite rapidly.

   Fortunately, beginning with the 4.2 release of Berkeley DB, the
   database environment has the ability to remove its own unused logfiles
   automatically. Any repositories created using svnadmin when compiled
   against Berkeley DB version 4.2 or later will be configured for this
   automatic logfile removal. If you don't want this feature enabled,
   simply pass the --bdb-log-keep option to the svnadmin create command.
   If you forget to do this or change your mind at a later time, simply
   edit the DB_CONFIG file found in your repository's db directory,
   comment out the line that contains the set_flags DB_LOG_AUTOREMOVE
   directive, and then run svnadmin recover on your repository to force
   the configuration changes to take effect. See the section called
   âBerkeley DB Configurationâ for more information about database
   configuration.

   Without some sort of automatic logfile removal in place, logfiles will
   accumulate as you use your repository. This is actually somewhat of a
   feature of the database systemâyou should be able to recreate your
   entire database using nothing but the logfiles, so these files can be
   useful for catastrophic database recovery. But typically, you'll want
   to archive the logfiles that are no longer in use by Berkeley DB, and
   then remove them from disk to conserve space. Use the svnadmin
   list-unused-dblogs command to list the unused logfiles:
$ svnadmin list-unused-dblogs /var/svn/repos
/var/svn/repos/log.0000000031
/var/svn/repos/log.0000000032
/var/svn/repos/log.0000000033
â¦
$ rm `svnadmin list-unused-dblogs /var/svn/repos`
## disk space reclaimed!

Warning

   BDB-backed repositories whose logfiles are used as part of a backup or
   disaster recovery plan should not make use of the logfile autoremoval
   feature. Reconstruction of a repository's data from logfiles can only
   be accomplished only when all the logfiles are available. If some of
   the logfiles are removed from disk before the backup system has a
   chance to copy them elsewhere, the incomplete set of backed-up logfiles
   is essentially useless.

Berkeley DB Recovery

   As mentioned in the section called âBerkeley DBâ, a Berkeley DB
   repository can sometimes be left in a frozen state if not closed
   properly. When this happens, an administrator needs to rewind the
   database back into a consistent state. This is unique to BDB-backed
   repositories, thoughâif you are using FSFS-backed ones instead, this
   won't apply to you. And for those of you using Subversion 1.4 with
   Berkeley DB 4.4 or later, you should find that Subversion has become
   much more resilient in these types of situations. Still, wedged
   Berkeley DB repositories do occur, and an administrator needs to know
   how to safely deal with this circumstance.

   To protect the data in your repository, Berkeley DB uses a locking
   mechanism. This mechanism ensures that portions of the database are not
   simultaneously modified by multiple database accessors, and that each
   process sees the data in the correct state when that data is being read
   from the database. When a process needs to change something in the
   database, it first checks for the existence of a lock on the target
   data. If the data is not locked, the process locks the data, makes the
   change it wants to make, and then unlocks the data. Other processes are
   forced to wait until that lock is removed before they are permitted to
   continue accessing that section of the database. (This has nothing to
   do with the locks that you, as a user, can apply to versioned files
   within the repository; we try to clear up the confusion caused by this
   terminology collision in the sidebar The Three Meanings of âLockâ.)

   In the course of using your Subversion repository, fatal errors or
   interruptions can prevent a process from having the chance to remove
   the locks it has placed in the database. The result is that the backend
   database system gets âwedged.â When this happens, any attempts to
   access the repository hang indefinitely (since each new accessor is
   waiting for a lock to go awayâwhich isn't going to happen).

   If this happens to your repository, don't panic. The Berkeley DB
   filesystem takes advantage of database transactions, checkpoints, and
   prewrite journaling to ensure that only the most catastrophic of events
   ^[33] can permanently destroy a database environment. A sufficiently
   paranoid repository administrator will have made off-site backups of
   the repository data in some fashion, but don't head off to the tape
   backup storage closet just yet.

   Instead, use the following recipe to attempt to âunwedgeâ your
   repository:
    1. Make sure no processes are accessing (or attempting to access) the
       repository. For networked repositories, this also means shutting
       down the Apache HTTP Server or svnserve daemon.
    2. Become the user who owns and manages the repository. This is
       important, as recovering a repository while running as the wrong
       user can tweak the permissions of the repository's files in such a
       way that your repository will still be inaccessible even after it
       is âunwedged.â
    3. Run the command svnadmin recover /var/svn/repos. You should see
       output such as this:
Repository lock acquired.
Please wait; recovering the repository may take some time...

Recovery completed.
The latest repos revision is 19.

       This command may take many minutes to complete.
    4. Restart the server process.

   This procedure fixes almost every case of repository wedging. Make sure
   that you run this command as the user that owns and manages the
   database, not just as root. Part of the recovery process might involve
   re-creating from scratch various database files (shared memory regions,
   e.g.). Recovering as root will create those files such that they are
   owned by root, which means that even after you restore connectivity to
   your repository, regular users will be unable to access it.

   If the previous procedure, for some reason, does not successfully
   unwedge your repository, you should do two things. First, move your
   broken repository directory aside (perhaps by renaming it to something
   like repos.BROKEN) and then restore your latest backup of it. Then,
   send an email to the Subversion users mailing list (at
   <users@subversion.tigris.org>) describing your problem in detail. Data
   integrity is an extremely high priority to the Subversion developers.

Migrating Repository Data Elsewhere

   A Subversion filesystem has its data spread throughout files in the
   repository, in a fashion generally understood by (and of interest to)
   only the Subversion developers themselves. However, circumstances may
   arise that call for all, or some subset, of that data to be copied or
   moved into another repository.

   Subversion provides such functionality by way of repository dump
   streams. A repository dump stream (often referred to as a âdump fileâ
   when stored as a file on disk) is a portable, flat file format that
   describes the various revisions in your repositoryâwhat was changed, by
   whom, when, and so on. This dump stream is the primary mechanism used
   to marshal versioned historyâin whole or in part, with or without
   modificationâbetween repositories. And Subversion provides the tools
   necessary for creating and loading these dump streams: the svnadmin
   dump and svnadmin load subcommands, respectively.

Warning

   While the Subversion repository dump format contains human-readable
   portions and a familiar structure (it resembles an RFC 822 format, the
   same type of format used for most email), it is not a plain-text file
   format. It is a binary file format, highly sensitive to meddling. For
   example, many text editors will corrupt the file by automatically
   converting line endings.

   There are many reasons for dumping and loading Subversion repository
   data. Early in Subversion's life, the most common reason was due to the
   evolution of Subversion itself. As Subversion matured, there were times
   when changes made to the backend database schema caused compatibility
   issues with previous versions of the repository, so users had to dump
   their repository data using the previous version of Subversion and load
   it into a freshly created repository with the new version of
   Subversion. Now, these types of schema changes haven't occurred since
   Subversion's 1.0 release, and the Subversion developers promise not to
   force users to dump and load their repositories when upgrading between
   minor versions (such as from 1.3 to 1.4) of Subversion. But there are
   still other reasons for dumping and loading, including re-deploying a
   Berkeley DB repository on a new OS or CPU architecture, switching
   between the Berkeley DB and FSFS backends, or (as we'll cover later in
   this chapter in the section called âFiltering Repository Historyâ)
   purging versioned data from repository history.

Note

   The Subversion repository dump format describes versioned repository
   changes only. It will not carry any information about uncommitted
   transactions, user locks on filesystem paths, repository or server
   configuration customizations (including hook scripts), and so on.

   Whatever your reason for migrating repository history, using the
   svnadmin dump and svnadmin load subcommands is straightforward.
   svnadmin dump will output a range of repository revisions that are
   formatted using Subversion's custom filesystem dump format. The dump
   format is printed to the standard output stream, while informative
   messages are printed to the standard error stream. This allows you to
   redirect the output stream to a file while watching the status output
   in your terminal window. For example:
$ svnlook youngest myrepos
26
$ svnadmin dump myrepos > dumpfile
* Dumped revision 0.
* Dumped revision 1.
* Dumped revision 2.
â¦
* Dumped revision 25.
* Dumped revision 26.

   At the end of the process, you will have a single file (dumpfile in the
   previous example) that contains all the data stored in your repository
   in the requested range of revisions. Note that svnadmin dump is reading
   revision trees from the repository just like any other âreaderâ process
   would (e.g., svn checkout), so it's safe to run this command at any
   time.

   The other subcommand in the pair, svnadmin load, parses the standard
   input stream as a Subversion repository dump file and effectively
   replays those dumped revisions into the target repository for that
   operation. It also gives informative feedback, this time using the
   standard output stream:
$ svnadmin load newrepos < dumpfile
<<< Started new txn, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : A ... done.
     * adding path : A/B ... done.
     â¦
------- Committed new rev 1 (loaded from original rev 1) >>>

<<< Started new txn, based on original revision 2
     * editing path : A/mu ... done.
     * editing path : A/D/G/rho ... done.

------- Committed new rev 2 (loaded from original rev 2) >>>

â¦

<<< Started new txn, based on original revision 25
     * editing path : A/D/gamma ... done.

------- Committed new rev 25 (loaded from original rev 25) >>>

<<< Started new txn, based on original revision 26
     * adding path : A/Z/zeta ... done.
     * editing path : A/mu ... done.

------- Committed new rev 26 (loaded from original rev 26) >>>


   The result of a load is new revisions added to a repositoryâthe same
   thing you get by making commits against that repository from a regular
   Subversion client. Just as in a commit, you can use hook programs to
   perform actions before and after each of the commits made during a load
   process. By passing the --use-pre-commit-hook and
   --use-post-commit-hook options to svnadmin load, you can instruct
   Subversion to execute the pre-commit and post-commit hook programs,
   respectively, for each loaded revision. You might use these, for
   example, to ensure that loaded revisions pass through the same
   validation steps that regular commits pass through. Of course, you
   should use these options with careâif your post-commit hook sends
   emails to a mailing list for each new commit, you might not want to
   spew hundreds or thousands of commit emails in rapid succession at that
   list! You can read more about the use of hook scripts in the section
   called âImplementing Repository Hooksâ.

   Note that because svnadmin uses standard input and output streams for
   the repository dump and load processes, people who are feeling
   especially saucy can try things such as this (perhaps even using
   different versions of svnadmin on each side of the pipe):
$ svnadmin create newrepos
$ svnadmin dump oldrepos | svnadmin load newrepos

   By default, the dump file will be quite largeâmuch larger than the
   repository itself. That's because by default every version of every
   file is expressed as a full text in the dump file. This is the fastest
   and simplest behavior, and it's nice if you're piping the dump data
   directly into some other process (such as a compression program,
   filtering program, or loading process). But if you're creating a dump
   file for longer-term storage, you'll likely want to save disk space by
   using the --deltas option. With this option, successive revisions of
   files will be output as compressed, binary differencesâjust as file
   revisions are stored in a repository. This option is slower, but it
   results in a dump file much closer in size to the original repository.

   We mentioned previously that svnadmin dump outputs a range of
   revisions. Use the --revision (-r) option to specify a single revision,
   or a range of revisions, to dump. If you omit this option, all the
   existing repository revisions will be dumped.
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 23 > rev-23.dumpfile
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 100:200 > revs-100-200.dumpfile

   As Subversion dumps each new revision, it outputs only enough
   information to allow a future loader to re-create that revision based
   on the previous one. In other words, for any given revision in the dump
   file, only the items that were changed in that revision will appear in
   the dump. The only exception to this rule is the first revision that is
   dumped with the current svnadmin dump command.

   By default, Subversion will not express the first dumped revision as
   merely differences to be applied to the previous revision. For one
   thing, there is no previous revision in the dump file! And second,
   Subversion cannot know the state of the repository into which the dump
   data will be loaded (if it ever is). To ensure that the output of each
   execution of svnadmin dump is self-sufficient, the first dumped
   revision is, by default, a full representation of every directory,
   file, and property in that revision of the repository.

   However, you can change this default behavior. If you add the
   --incremental option when you dump your repository, svnadmin will
   compare the first dumped revision against the previous revision in the
   repositoryâthe same way it treats every other revision that gets
   dumped. It will then output the first revision exactly as it does the
   rest of the revisions in the dump rangeâmentioning only the changes
   that occurred in that revision. The benefit of this is that you can
   create several small dump files that can be loaded in succession,
   instead of one large one, like so:
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 0:1000 > dumpfile1
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 1001:2000 --incremental > dumpfile2
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 2001:3000 --incremental > dumpfile3

   These dump files could be loaded into a new repository with the
   following command sequence:
$ svnadmin load newrepos < dumpfile1
$ svnadmin load newrepos < dumpfile2
$ svnadmin load newrepos < dumpfile3

   Another neat trick you can perform with this --incremental option
   involves appending to an existing dump file a new range of dumped
   revisions. For example, you might have a post-commit hook that simply
   appends the repository dump of the single revision that triggered the
   hook. Or you might have a script that runs nightly to append dump file
   data for all the revisions that were added to the repository since the
   last time the script ran. Used like this, svnadmin dump can be one way
   to back up changes to your repository over time in case of a system
   crash or some other catastrophic event.

   The dump format can also be used to merge the contents of several
   different repositories into a single repository. By using the
   --parent-dir option of svnadmin load, you can specify a new virtual
   root directory for the load process. That means if you have dump files
   for three repositoriesâsay calc-dumpfile, cal-dumpfile, and
   ss-dumpfileâyou can first create a new repository to hold them all:
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/projects
$

   Then, make new directories in the repository that will encapsulate the
   contents of each of the three previous repositories:
$ svn mkdir -m "Initial project roots" \
      file:///var/svn/projects/calc \
      file:///var/svn/projects/calendar \
      file:///var/svn/projects/spreadsheet
Committed revision 1.
$

   Lastly, load the individual dump files into their respective locations
   in the new repository:
$ svnadmin load /var/svn/projects --parent-dir calc < calc-dumpfile
â¦
$ svnadmin load /var/svn/projects --parent-dir calendar < cal-dumpfile
â¦
$ svnadmin load /var/svn/projects --parent-dir spreadsheet < ss-dumpfile
â¦
$

   We'll mention one final way to use the Subversion repository dump
   formatâconversion from a different storage mechanism or version control
   system altogether. Because the dump file format is, for the most part,
   human-readable, it should be relatively easy to describe generic sets
   of changesâeach of which should be treated as a new revisionâusing this
   file format. In fact, the cvs2svn utility (see the section called
   âConverting a Repository from CVS to Subversionâ) uses the dump format
   to represent the contents of a CVS repository so that those contents
   can be copied into a Subversion repository.

Filtering Repository History

   Since Subversion stores your versioned history using, at the very
   least, binary differencing algorithms and data compression (optionally
   in a completely opaque database system), attempting manual tweaks is
   unwise if not quite difficult, and at any rate strongly discouraged.
   And once data has been stored in your repository, Subversion generally
   doesn't provide an easy way to remove that data. ^[34] But inevitably,
   there will be times when you would like to manipulate the history of
   your repository. You might need to strip out all instances of a file
   that was accidentally added to the repository (and shouldn't be there
   for whatever reason). ^[35] Or, perhaps you have multiple projects
   sharing a single repository, and you decide to split them up into their
   own repositories. To accomplish tasks such as these, administrators
   need a more manageable and malleable representation of the data in
   their repositoriesâthe Subversion repository dump format.

   As we described earlier in the section called âMigrating Repository
   Data Elsewhereâ, the Subversion repository dump format is a
   human-readable representation of the changes that you've made to your
   versioned data over time. Use the svnadmin dump command to generate the
   dump data, and svnadmin load to populate a new repository with it. The
   great thing about the human-readability aspect of the dump format is
   that, if you aren't careless about it, you can manually inspect and
   modify it. Of course, the downside is that if you have three years'
   worth of repository activity encapsulated in what is likely to be a
   very large dump file, it could take you a long, long time to manually
   inspect and modify it.

   That's where svndumpfilter becomes useful. This program acts as a
   path-based filter for repository dump streams. Simply give it either a
   list of paths you wish to keep or a list of paths you wish to not keep,
   and then pipe your repository dump data through this filter. The result
   will be a modified stream of dump data that contains only the versioned
   paths you (explicitly or implicitly) requested.

   Let's look at a realistic example of how you might use this program.
   Earlier in this chapter (see the section called âPlanning Your
   Repository Organizationâ), we discussed the process of deciding how to
   choose a layout for the data in your repositoriesâusing one repository
   per project or combining them, arranging stuff within your repository,
   and so on. But sometimes after new revisions start flying in, you
   rethink your layout and would like to make some changes. A common
   change is the decision to move multiple projects that are sharing a
   single repository into separate repositories for each project.

   Our imaginary repository contains three projects: calc, calendar, and
   spreadsheet. They have been living side-by-side in a layout like this:
/
   calc/
      trunk/
      branches/
      tags/
   calendar/
      trunk/
      branches/
      tags/
   spreadsheet/
      trunk/
      branches/
      tags/

   To get these three projects into their own repositories, we first dump
   the whole repository:
$ svnadmin dump /var/svn/repos > repos-dumpfile
* Dumped revision 0.
* Dumped revision 1.
* Dumped revision 2.
* Dumped revision 3.
â¦
$

   Next, run that dump file through the filter, each time including only
   one of our top-level directories. This results in three new dump files:
$ svndumpfilter include calc < repos-dumpfile > calc-dumpfile
â¦
$ svndumpfilter include calendar < repos-dumpfile > cal-dumpfile
â¦
$ svndumpfilter include spreadsheet < repos-dumpfile > ss-dumpfile
â¦
$

   At this point, you have to make a decision. Each of your dump files
   will create a valid repository, but will preserve the paths exactly as
   they were in the original repository. This means that even though you
   would have a repository solely for your calc project, that repository
   would still have a top-level directory named calc. If you want your
   trunk, tags, and branches directories to live in the root of your
   repository, you might wish to edit your dump files, tweaking the
   Node-path and Node-copyfrom-path headers so that they no longer have
   that first calc/ path component. Also, you'll want to remove the
   section of dump data that creates the calc directory. It will look
   something like the following:
Node-path: calc
Node-action: add
Node-kind: dir
Content-length: 0


Warning

   If you do plan on manually editing the dump file to remove a top-level
   directory, make sure your editor is not set to automatically convert
   end-of-line characters to the native format (e.g., \r\n to \n), as the
   content will then not agree with the metadata. This will render the
   dump file useless.

   All that remains now is to create your three new repositories, and load
   each dump file into the right repository, ignoring the UUID found in
   the dump stream:
$ svnadmin create calc
$ svnadmin load --ignore-uuid calc < calc-dumpfile
<<< Started new transaction, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : Makefile ... done.
     * adding path : button.c ... done.
â¦
$ svnadmin create calendar
$ svnadmin load --ignore-uuid calendar < cal-dumpfile
<<< Started new transaction, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : Makefile ... done.
     * adding path : cal.c ... done.
â¦
$ svnadmin create spreadsheet
$ svnadmin load --ignore-uuid spreadsheet < ss-dumpfile
<<< Started new transaction, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : Makefile ... done.
     * adding path : ss.c ... done.
â¦
$

   Both of svndumpfilter's subcommands accept options for deciding how to
   deal with âemptyâ revisions. If a given revision contains only changes
   to paths that were filtered out, that now-empty revision could be
   considered uninteresting or even unwanted. So to give the user control
   over what to do with those revisions, svndumpfilter provides the
   following command-line options:

   --drop-empty-revs
          Do not generate empty revisions at allâjust omit them.

   --renumber-revs
          If empty revisions are dropped (using the --drop-empty-revs
          option), change the revision numbers of the remaining revisions
          so that there are no gaps in the numeric sequence.

   --preserve-revprops
          If empty revisions are not dropped, preserve the revision
          properties (log message, author, date, custom properties, etc.)
          for those empty revisions. Otherwise, empty revisions will
          contain only the original datestamp, and a generated log message
          that indicates that this revision was emptied by svndumpfilter.

   While svndumpfilter can be very useful and a huge timesaver, there are
   unfortunately a couple of gotchas. First, this utility is overly
   sensitive to path semantics. Pay attention to whether paths in your
   dump file are specified with or without leading slashes. You'll want to
   look at the Node-path and Node-copyfrom-path headers.
â¦
Node-path: spreadsheet/Makefile
â¦

   If the paths have leading slashes, you should include leading slashes
   in the paths you pass to svndumpfilter include and svndumpfilter
   exclude (and if they don't, you shouldn't). Further, if your dump file
   has an inconsistent usage of leading slashes for some reason, ^[36] you
   should probably normalize those paths so that they all have, or all
   lack, leading slashes.

   Also, copied paths can give you some trouble. Subversion supports copy
   operations in the repository, where a new path is created by copying
   some already existing path. It is possible that at some point in the
   lifetime of your repository, you might have copied a file or directory
   from some location that svndumpfilter is excluding, to a location that
   it is including. To make the dump data self-sufficient, svndumpfilter
   needs to still show the addition of the new pathâincluding the contents
   of any files created by the copyâand not represent that addition as a
   copy from a source that won't exist in your filtered dump data stream.
   But because the Subversion repository dump format shows only what was
   changed in each revision, the contents of the copy source might not be
   readily available. If you suspect that you have any copies of this sort
   in your repository, you might want to rethink your set of
   included/excluded paths, perhaps including the paths that served as
   sources of your troublesome copy operations, too.

   Finally, svndumpfilter takes path filtering quite literally. If you are
   trying to copy the history of a project rooted at trunk/my-project and
   move it into a repository of its own, you would, of course, use the
   svndumpfilter include command to keep all the changes in and under
   trunk/my-project. But the resultant dump file makes no assumptions
   about the repository into which you plan to load this data.
   Specifically, the dump data might begin with the revision that added
   the trunk/my-project directory, but it will not contain directives that
   would create the trunk directory itself (because trunk doesn't match
   the include filter). You'll need to make sure that any directories that
   the new dump stream expects to exist actually do exist in the target
   repository before trying to load the stream into that repository.

Repository Replication

   There are several scenarios in which it is quite handy to have a
   Subversion repository whose version history is exactly the same as some
   other repository's. Perhaps the most obvious one is the maintenance of
   a simple backup repository, used when the primary repository has become
   inaccessible due to a hardware failure, network outage, or other such
   annoyance. Other scenarios include deploying mirror repositories to
   distribute heavy Subversion load across multiple servers, use as a
   soft-upgrade mechanism, and so on.

   As of version 1.4, Subversion provides a program for managing scenarios
   such as theseâsvnsync. This works by essentially asking the Subversion
   server to âreplayâ revisions, one at a time. It then uses that revision
   information to mimic a commit of the same to another repository.
   Neither repository needs to be locally accessible to the machine on
   which svnsync is runningâits parameters are repository URLs, and it
   does all its work through Subversion's Repository Access (RA)
   interfaces. All it requires is read access to the source repository and
   read/write access to the destination repository.

Note

   When using svnsync against a remote source repository, the Subversion
   server for that repository must be running Subversion version 1.4 or
   later.

   Assuming you already have a source repository that you'd like to
   mirror, the next thing you need is an empty target repository that will
   actually serve as that mirror. This target repository can use either of
   the available filesystem data-store backends (see the section called
   âChoosing a Data Storeâ), but it must not yet have any version history
   in it. The protocol that svnsync uses to communicate revision
   information is highly sensitive to mismatches between the versioned
   histories contained in the source and target repositories. For this
   reason, while svnsync cannot demand that the target repository be
   read-only, ^[37] allowing the revision history in the target repository
   to change by any mechanism other than the mirroring process is a recipe
   for disaster.

Warning

   Do not modify a mirror repository in such a way as to cause its version
   history to deviate from that of the repository it mirrors. The only
   commits and revision property modifications that ever occur on that
   mirror repository should be those performed by the svnsync tool.

   Another requirement of the target repository is that the svnsync
   process be allowed to modify revision properties. Because svnsync works
   within the framework of that repository's hook system, the default
   state of the repository (which is to disallow revision property
   changes; see pre-revprop-change) is insufficient. You'll need to
   explicitly implement the pre-revprop-change hook, and your script must
   allow svnsync to set and change revision properties. With those
   provisions in place, you are ready to start mirroring repository
   revisions.

Tip

   It's a good idea to implement authorization measures that allow your
   repository replication process to perform its tasks while preventing
   other users from modifying the contents of your mirror repository at
   all.

   Let's walk through the use of svnsync in a somewhat typical mirroring
   scenario. We'll pepper this discourse with practical recommendations,
   which you are free to disregard if they aren't required by or suitable
   for your environment.

   As a service to the fine developers of our favorite version control
   system, we will be mirroring the public Subversion source code
   repository and exposing that mirror publicly on the Internet, hosted on
   a different machine than the one on which the original Subversion
   source code repository lives. This remote host has a global
   configuration that permits anonymous users to read the contents of
   repositories on the host, but requires users to authenticate to modify
   those repositories. (Please forgive us for glossing over the details of
   Subversion server configuration for the momentâthose are covered
   thoroughly in Chapter 6, Server Configuration.) And for no other reason
   than that it makes for a more interesting example, we'll be driving the
   replication process from a third machineâthe one that we currently find
   ourselves using.

   First, we'll create the repository which will be our mirror. This and
   the next couple of steps do require shell access to the machine on
   which the mirror repository will live. Once the repository is all
   configured, though, we shouldn't need to touch it directly again.
$ ssh admin@svn.example.com \
      "svnadmin create /var/svn/svn-mirror"
admin@svn.example.com's password: ********
$

   At this point, we have our repository, and due to our server's
   configuration, that repository is now âliveâ on the Internet. Now,
   because we don't want anything modifying the repository except our
   replication process, we need a way to distinguish that process from
   other would-be committers. To do so, we use a dedicated username for
   our process. Only commits and revision property modifications performed
   by the special username syncuser will be allowed.

   We'll use the repository's hook system both to allow the replication
   process to do what it needs to do and to enforce that only it is doing
   those things. We accomplish this by implementing two of the repository
   event hooksâpre-revprop-change and start-commit. Our pre-revprop-change
   hook script is found in Example 5.2, âMirror repository's
   pre-revprop-change hook scriptâ, and basically verifies that the user
   attempting the property changes is our syncuser user. If so, the change
   is allowed; otherwise, it is denied.

   Example 5.2. Mirror repository's pre-revprop-change hook script
#!/bin/sh

USER="$3"

if [ "$USER" = "syncuser" ]; then exit 0; fi

echo "Only the syncuser user may change revision properties" >&2
exit 1

   That covers revision property changes. Now we need to ensure that only
   the syncuser user is permitted to commit new revisions to the
   repository. We do this using a start-commit hook scripts such as the
   one in Example 5.3, âMirror repository's start-commit hook scriptâ.

   Example 5.3. Mirror repository's start-commit hook script
#!/bin/sh

USER="$2"

if [ "$USER" = "syncuser" ]; then exit 0; fi

echo "Only the syncuser user may commit new revisions" >&2
exit 1

   After installing our hook scripts and ensuring that they are executable
   by the Subversion server, we're finished with the setup of the mirror
   repository. Now, we get to actually do the mirroring.

   The first thing we need to do with svnsync is to register in our target
   repository the fact that it will be a mirror of the source repository.
   We do this using the svnsync initialize subcommand. The URLs we provide
   point to the root directories of the target and source repositories,
   respectively. In Subversion 1.4, this is requiredâonly full mirroring
   of repositories is permitted. In Subversion 1.5, though, you can use
   svnsync to mirror only some subtree of the repository, too.
$ svnsync help init
initialize (init): usage: svnsync initialize DEST_URL SOURCE_URL

Initialize a destination repository for synchronization from
another repository.
â¦
$ svnsync initialize http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror \
                     http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn \
                     --sync-username syncuser --sync-password syncpass
Copied properties for revision 0.
$

   Our target repository will now remember that it is a mirror of the
   public Subversion source code repository. Notice that we provided a
   username and password as arguments to svnsyncâthat was required by the
   pre-revprop-change hook on our mirror repository.

Note

   In Subversion 1.4, the values given to svnsync's --username and
   --password command-line options were used for authentication against
   both the source and destination repositories. This caused problems when
   a user's credentials weren't exactly the same for both repositories,
   especially when running in noninteractive mode (with the
   --non-interactive option).

   This has been fixed in Subversion 1.5 with the introduction of two new
   pairs of options. Use --source-username and --source-password to
   provide authentication credentials for the source repository; use
   --sync-username and --sync-password to provide credentials for the
   destination repository. (The old --username and --password options
   still exist for compatibility, but we advise against using them.)

   And now comes the fun part. With a single subcommand, we can tell
   svnsync to copy all the as-yet-unmirrored revisions from the source
   repository to the target. ^[38] The svnsync synchronize subcommand will
   peek into the special revision properties previously stored on the
   target repository, and determine both what repository it is mirroring
   as well as that the most recently mirrored revision was revision 0.
   Then it will query the source repository and determine what the latest
   revision in that repository is. Finally, it asks the source
   repository's server to start replaying all the revisions between 0 and
   that latest revision. As svnsync get the resultant response from the
   source repository's server, it begins forwarding those revisions to the
   target repository's server as new commits.
$ svnsync help synchronize
synchronize (sync): usage: svnsync synchronize DEST_URL

Transfer all pending revisions to the destination from the source
with which it was initialized.
â¦
$ svnsync synchronize http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror

$

   Of particular interest here is that for each mirrored revision, there
   is first a commit of that revision to the target repository, and then
   property changes follow. This is because the initial commit is
   performed by (and attributed to) the user syncuser, and it is
   datestamped with the time as of that revision's creation. Also,
   Subversion's underlying repository access interfaces don't provide a
   mechanism for setting arbitrary revision properties as part of a
   commit. So svnsync follows up with an immediate series of property
   modifications that copy into the target repository all the revision
   properties found for that revision in the source repository. This also
   has the effect of fixing the author and datestamp of the revision to
   match that of the source repository.

   Also noteworthy is that svnsync performs careful bookkeeping that
   allows it to be safely interrupted and restarted without ruining the
   integrity of the mirrored data. If a network glitch occurs while
   mirroring a repository, simply repeat the svnsync synchronize command,
   and it will happily pick up right where it left off. In fact, as new
   revisions appear in the source repository, this is exactly what you to
   do to keep your mirror up to date.

   svnsync Bookkeeping

   svnsync needs to be able to set and modify revision properties on the
   mirror repository because those properties are part of the data it is
   tasked with mirroring. As those properties change in the source
   repository, those changes need to be reflected in the mirror
   repository, too. But svnsync also uses a set of custom revision
   propertiesâstored in revision 0 of the mirror repositoryâfor its own
   internal bookkeeping. These properties contain information such as the
   URL and UUID of the source repository, plus some additional
   state-tracking information.

   One of those pieces of state-tracking information is a flag that
   essentially just means âthere's a synchronization in progress right
   now.â This is used to prevent multiple svnsync processes from colliding
   with each other while trying to mirror data to the same destination
   repository. Now, generally you won't need to pay any attention
   whatsoever to any of these special properties (all of which begin with
   the prefix svn:sync-). Occasionally, though, if a synchronization fails
   unexpectedly, Subversion never has a chance to remove this particular
   state flag. This causes all future synchronization attempts to fail
   because it appears that a synchronization is still in progress when, in
   fact, none is. Fortunately, recovering from this situation is as simple
   as removing the svn:sync-lock property which serves as this flag from
   revision 0 of the mirror repository:
$ svn propdel --revprop -r0 svn:sync-lock http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror
property 'svn:sync-lock' deleted from repository revision 0
$

   That svnsync stores the source repository URL in a bookkeeping property
   on the mirror repository is the reason why you have to specify that URL
   only once, during svnsync init. Future synchronization operations
   against that mirror simply consult the special svn:sync-from-url
   property stored on the mirror itself to know where to synchronize from.
   This value is used literally by the synchronization process, though. So
   while from within CollabNet's network you can perhaps access our
   example source URL as http://svn/repos/svn (because that first svn
   magically gets .collab.net appended to it by DNS voodoo), if you later
   need to update that mirror from another machine outside CollabNet's
   network, the synchronization might fail (because the hostname svn is
   ambiguous). For this reason, it's best to use fully qualified source
   repository URLs when initializing a mirror repository rather than those
   that refer to only hostnames or IP addresses (which can change over
   time). But here again, if you need an existing mirror to start
   referring to a different URL for the same source repository, you can
   change the bookkeeping property which houses that information:
$ svn propset --revprop -r0 svn:sync-from-url NEW-SOURCE-URL \
      http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror
property 'svn:sync-from-url' set on repository revision 0
$

   Another interesting thing about these special bookkeeping properties is
   that svnsync will not attempt to mirror any of those properties when
   they are found in the source repository. The reason is probably
   obvious, but basically boils down to svnsync not being able to
   distinguish the special properties it has merely copied from the source
   repository from those it needs to consult and maintain for its own
   bookkeeping needs. This situation could occur if, for example, you were
   maintaining a mirror of a mirror of a third repository. When svnsync
   sees its own special properties in revision 0 of the source repository,
   it simply ignores them.

   There is, however, one bit of inelegance in the process. Because
   Subversion revision properties can be changed at any time throughout
   the lifetime of the repository, and because they don't leave an audit
   trail that indicates when they were changed, replication processes have
   to pay special attention to them. If you've already mirrored the first
   15 revisions of a repository and someone then changes a revision
   property on revision 12, svnsync won't know to go back and patch up its
   copy of revision 12. You'll need to tell it to do so manually by using
   (or with some additional tooling around) the svnsync copy-revprops
   subcommand, which simply rereplicates all the revision properties for a
   particular revision or range thereof.
$ svnsync help copy-revprops
copy-revprops: usage: svnsync copy-revprops DEST_URL [REV[:REV2]]

Copy the revision properties in a given range of revisions to the
destination from the source with which it was initialized.
â¦
$ svnsync copy-revprops http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror 12
Copied properties for revision 12.
$

   That's repository replication in a nutshell. You'll likely want some
   automation around such a process. For example, while our example was a
   pull-and-push setup, you might wish to have your primary repository
   push changes to one or more blessed mirrors as part of its post-commit
   and post-revprop-change hook implementations. This would enable the
   mirror to be up to date in as near to real time as is likely possible.

   Also, while it isn't very commonplace to do so, svnsync does gracefully
   mirror repositories in which the user as whom it authenticates has only
   partial read access. It simply copies only the bits of the repository
   that it is permitted to see. Obviously, such a mirror is not useful as
   a backup solution.

   In Subversion 1.5, svnsync grew the ability to also mirror a subset of
   a repository rather than the whole thing. The process of setting up and
   maintaining such a mirror is exactly the same as when mirroring a whole
   repository, except that instead of specifying the source repository's
   root URL when running svnsync init, you specify the URL of some
   subdirectory within that repository. Synchronization to that mirror
   will now copy only the bits that changed under that source repository
   subdirectory. There are some limitations to this support, though.
   First, you can't mirror multiple disjoint subdirectories of the source
   repository into a single mirror repositoryâyou'd need to instead mirror
   some parent directory that is common to both. Second, the filtering
   logic is entirely path-based, so if the subdirectory you are mirroring
   was renamed at some point in the past, your mirror would contain only
   the revisions since the directory appeared at the URL you specified.
   And likewise, if the source subdirectory is renamed in the future, your
   synchronization processes will stop mirroring data at the point that
   the source URL you specified is no longer valid.

   As far as user interaction with repositories and mirrors goes, it is
   possible to have a single working copy that interacts with both, but
   you'll have to jump through some hoops to make it happen. First, you
   need to ensure that both the primary and mirror repositories have the
   same repository UUID (which is not the case by default). See the
   section called âManaging Repository UUIDsâ later in this chapter for
   more about this.

   Once the two repositories have the same UUID, you can use svn switch
   with the --relocate option to point your working copy to whichever of
   the repositories you wish to operate against, a process that is
   described in svn switch. There is a possible danger here, though, in
   that if the primary and mirror repositories aren't in close
   synchronization, a working copy up to date with, and pointing to, the
   primary repository will, if relocated to point to an out-of-date
   mirror, become confused about the apparent sudden loss of revisions it
   fully expects to be present, and it will throw errors to that effect.
   If this occurs, you can relocate your working copy back to the primary
   repository and then either wait until the mirror repository is up to
   date, or backdate your working copy to a revision you know is present
   in the sync repository, and then retry the relocation.

   Finally, be aware that the revision-based replication provided by
   svnsync is only thatâreplication of revisions. Only information carried
   by the Subversion repository dump file format is available for
   replication. As such, svnsync has the same sorts of limitations that
   the repository dump stream has, and does not include such things as the
   hook implementations, repository or server configuration data,
   uncommitted transactions, or information about user locks on repository
   paths.

Repository Backup

   Despite numerous advances in technology since the birth of the modern
   computer, one thing unfortunately rings true with crystalline
   clarityâsometimes things go very, very awry. Power outages, network
   connectivity dropouts, corrupt RAM, and crashed hard drives are but a
   taste of the evil that Fate is poised to unleash on even the most
   conscientious administrator. And so we arrive at a very important
   topicâhow to make backup copies of your repository data.

   There are two types of backup methods available for Subversion
   repository administratorsâfull and incremental. A full backup of the
   repository involves squirreling away in one sweeping action all the
   information required to fully reconstruct that repository in the event
   of a catastrophe. Usually, it means, quite literally, the duplication
   of the entire repository directory (which includes either a Berkeley DB
   or FSFS environment). Incremental backups are lesser things: backups of
   only the portion of the repository data that has changed since the
   previous backup.

   As far as full backups go, the naÃ¯ve approach might seem like a sane
   one, but unless you temporarily disable all other access to your
   repository, simply doing a recursive directory copy runs the risk of
   generating a faulty backup. In the case of Berkeley DB, the
   documentation describes a certain order in which database files can be
   copied that will guarantee a valid backup copy. A similar ordering
   exists for FSFS data. But you don't have to implement these algorithms
   yourself, because the Subversion development team has already done so.
   The svnadmin hotcopy command takes care of the minutia involved in
   making a hot backup of your repository. And its invocation is as
   trivial as the Unix cp or Windows copy operations:
$ svnadmin hotcopy /var/svn/repos /var/svn/repos-backup

   The resultant backup is a fully functional Subversion repository, able
   to be dropped in as a replacement for your live repository should
   something go horribly wrong.

   When making copies of a Berkeley DB repository, you can even instruct
   svnadmin hotcopy to purge any unused Berkeley DB logfiles (see the
   section called âPurging unused Berkeley DB logfilesâ) from the original
   repository upon completion of the copy. Simply provide the --clean-logs
   option on the command line.
$ svnadmin hotcopy --clean-logs /var/svn/bdb-repos /var/svn/bdb-repos-backup

   Additional tooling around this command is available, too. The
   tools/backup/ directory of the Subversion source distribution holds the
   hot-backup.py script. This script adds a bit of backup management atop
   svnadmin hotcopy, allowing you to keep only the most recent configured
   number of backups of each repository. It will automatically manage the
   names of the backed-up repository directories to avoid collisions with
   previous backups and will ârotate offâ older backups, deleting them so
   that only the most recent ones remain. Even if you also have an
   incremental backup, you might want to run this program on a regular
   basis. For example, you might consider using hot-backup.py from a
   program scheduler (such as cron on Unix systems), which can cause it to
   run nightly (or at whatever granularity of time you deem safe).

   Some administrators use a different backup mechanism built around
   generating and storing repository dump data. We described in the
   section called âMigrating Repository Data Elsewhereâ how to use
   svnadmin dump with the --incremental option to perform an incremental
   backup of a given revision or range of revisions. And of course, you
   can achieve a full backup variation of this by omitting the
   --incremental option to that command. There is some value in these
   methods, in that the format of your backed-up information is
   flexibleâit's not tied to a particular platform, versioned filesystem
   type, or release of Subversion or Berkeley DB. But that flexibility
   comes at a cost, namely that restoring that data can take a long
   timeâlonger with each new revision committed to your repository. Also,
   as is the case with so many of the various backup methods, revision
   property changes that are made to already backed-up revisions won't get
   picked up by a nonoverlapping, incremental dump generation. For these
   reasons, we recommend against relying solely on dump-based backup
   approaches.

   As you can see, each of the various backup types and methods has its
   advantages and disadvantages. The easiest is by far the full hot
   backup, which will always result in a perfect working replica of your
   repository. Should something bad happen to your live repository, you
   can restore from the backup with a simple recursive directory copy.
   Unfortunately, if you are maintaining multiple backups of your
   repository, these full copies will each eat up just as much disk space
   as your live repository. Incremental backups, by contrast, tend to be
   quicker to generate and smaller to store. But the restoration process
   can be a pain, often involving applying multiple incremental backups.
   And other methods have their own peculiarities. Administrators need to
   find the balance between the cost of making the backup and the cost of
   restoring it.

   The svnsync program (see the section called âRepository Replicationâ)
   actually provides a rather handy middle-ground approach. If you are
   regularly synchronizing a read-only mirror with your main repository,
   in a pinch your read-only mirror is probably a good candidate for
   replacing that main repository if it falls over. The primary
   disadvantage of this method is that only the versioned repository data
   gets synchronizedârepository configuration files, user-specified
   repository path locks, and other items that might live in the physical
   repository directory but not inside the repository's virtual versioned
   filesystem are not handled by svnsync.

   In any backup scenario, repository administrators need to be aware of
   how modifications to unversioned revision properties affect their
   backups. Since these changes do not themselves generate new revisions,
   they will not trigger post-commit hooks, and may not even trigger the
   pre-revprop-change and post-revprop-change hooks. ^[39] And since you
   can change revision properties without respect to chronological
   orderâyou can change any revision's properties at any timeâan
   incremental backup of the latest few revisions might not catch a
   property modification to a revision that was included as part of a
   previous backup.

   Generally speaking, only the truly paranoid would need to back up their
   entire repository, say, every time a commit occurred. However, assuming
   that a given repository has some other redundancy mechanism in place
   with relatively fine granularity (such as per-commit emails or
   incremental dumps), a hot backup of the database might be something
   that a repository administrator would want to include as part of a
   system-wide nightly backup. It's your dataâprotect it as much as you'd
   like.

   Often, the best approach to repository backups is a diversified one
   that leverages combinations of the methods described here. The
   Subversion developers, for example, back up the Subversion source code
   repository nightly using hot-backup.py and an off-site rsync of those
   full backups; keep multiple archives of all the commit and property
   change notification emails; and have repository mirrors maintained by
   various volunteers using svnsync. Your solution might be similar, but
   should be catered to your needs and that delicate balance of
   convenience with paranoia. And whatever you do, validate your backups
   from time to timeâwhat good is a spare tire that has a hole in it?
   While all of this might not save your hardware from the iron fist of
   Fate, ^[40] it should certainly help you recover from those trying
   times.

Managing Repository UUIDs

   Subversion repositories have a universally unique identifier (UUID)
   associated with them. This is used by Subversion clients to verify the
   identity of a repository when other forms of verification aren't good
   enough (such as checking the repository URL, which can change over
   time). Most Subversion repository administrators rarely, if ever, need
   to think about repository UUIDs as anything more than a trivial
   implementation detail of Subversion. Sometimes, however, there is cause
   for attention to this detail.

   As a general rule, you want the UUIDs of your live repositories to be
   unique. That is, after all, the point of having UUIDs. But there are
   times when you want the repository UUIDs of two repositories to be
   exactly the same. For example, if you make a copy of a repository for
   backup purposes, you want the backup to be a perfect replica of the
   original so that, in the event that you have to restore that backup and
   replace the live repository, users don't suddenly see what looks like a
   different repository. When dumping and loading repository history (as
   described earlier in the section called âMigrating Repository Data
   Elsewhereâ), you get to decide whether to apply the UUID encapsulated
   in the data dump stream to the repository in which you are loading the
   data. The particular circumstance will dictate the correct behavior.

   There are a couple of ways to set (or reset) a repository's UUID,
   should you need to. As of Subversion 1.5, this is as simple as using
   the svnadmin setuuid command. If you provide this subcommand with an
   explicit UUID, it will validate that the UUID is well-formed and then
   set the repository UUID to that value. If you omit the UUID, a
   brand-new UUID will be generated for your repository.
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
$ svnadmin setuuid /var/svn/repos   # generate a new UUID
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
3c3c38fe-acc0-11dc-acbc-1b37ff1c8e7c
$ svnadmin setuuid /var/svn/repos \
           cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec  # restore the old UUID
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
$

   For folks using versions of Subversion earlier than 1.5, these tasks
   are a little more complicated. You can explicitly set a repository's
   UUID by piping a repository dump file stub that carries the new UUID
   specification through svnadmin load --force-uuid REPOS-PATH.
$ svnadmin load --force-uuid /var/svn/repos <<EOF
SVN-fs-dump-format-version: 2

UUID: cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
EOF
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
$

   Having older versions of Subversion generate a brand-new UUID is not
   quite as simple to do, though. Your best bet here is to find some other
   way to generate a UUID, and then explicitly set the repository's UUID
   to that value.

Moving and Removing Repositories

   Subversion repository data is wholly contained within the repository
   directory. As such, you can move a Subversion repository to some other
   location on disk, rename a repository, copy a repository, or delete a
   repository altogether using the tools provided by your operating system
   for manipulating directoriesâmv, cp -a, and rm -r on Unix platforms;
   copy, move, and rmdir /s /q on Windows; vast numbers of mouse and menu
   gyrations in various graphical file explorer applications, and so on.

   Of course, there's often still more to be done when trying to cleanly
   affect changes such as this. For example, you might need to update your
   Subversion server configuration to point to the new location of a
   relocated repository or to remove configuration bits for a now-deleted
   repository. If you have automated processes that publish information
   from or about your repositories, they may need to be updated. Hook
   scripts might need to be reconfigured. Users may need to be notified.
   The list can go on indefinitely, or at least to the extent that you've
   built processes and procedures around your Subversion repository.

   In the case of a copied repository, you should also consider the fact
   that Subversion uses repository UUIDs to distinguish repositories. If
   you copy a Subversion repository using a typical shell recursive copy
   command, you'll wind up with two repositories that are identical in
   every wayâincluding their UUIDs. In some circumstances, this might be
   desirable. But in the instances where it is not, you'll need to
   generate a new UUID for one of these identical repositories. See the
   section called âManaging Repository UUIDsâ for more about managing
   repository UUIDs.

Summary

   By now you should have a basic understanding of how to create,
   configure, and maintain Subversion repositories. We introduced you to
   the various tools that will assist you with this task. Throughout the
   chapter, we noted common administration pitfalls and offered
   suggestions for avoiding them.

   All that remains is for you to decide what exciting data to store in
   your repository, and finally, how to make it available over a network.
   The next chapter is all about networking.

   Path-Based Authorization
   Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods

   A Subversion repository can be accessed simultaneously by clients
   running on the same machine on which the repository resides using the
   file:// method. But the typical Subversion setup involves a single
   server machine being accessed from clients on computers all over the
   officeâor, perhaps, all over the world.

   This chapter describes how to get your Subversion repository exposed
   outside its host machine for use by remote clients. We will cover
   Subversion's currently available server mechanisms, discussing the
   configuration and use of each. After reading this chapter, you should
   be able to decide which networking setup is right for your needs, as
   well as understand how to enable such a setup on your host computer.

Overview

   Subversion was designed with an abstract network layer. This means that
   a repository can be programmatically accessed by any sort of server
   process, and the client ârepository accessâ API allows programmers to
   write plug-ins that speak relevant network protocols. In theory,
   Subversion can use an infinite number of network implementations. In
   practice, there are only two servers at the time of this writing.

   Apache is an extremely popular web server; using the mod_dav_svn
   module, Apache can access a repository and make it available to clients
   via the WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, which is an extension of HTTP. Because
   Apache is an extremely extensible server, it provides a number of
   features âfor free,â such as encrypted SSL communication, logging,
   integration with a number of third-party authentication systems, and
   limited built-in web browsing of repositories.

   In the other corner is svnserve: a small, lightweight server program
   that speaks a custom protocol with clients. Because its protocol is
   explicitly designed for Subversion and is stateful (unlike HTTP), it
   provides significantly faster network operationsâbut at the cost of
   some features as well. While it can use SASL to provide a variety of
   authentication and encryption options, it has no logging or built-in
   web browsing. It is, however, extremely easy to set up and is often the
   best option for small teams just starting out with Subversion.

   A third option is to use svnserve tunneled over an SSH connection. Even
   though this scenario still uses svnserve, it differs quite a bit in
   features from a traditional svnserve deployment. SSH is used to encrypt
   all communication. SSH is also used exclusively to authenticate, so
   real system accounts are required on the server host (unlike vanilla
   svnserve, which has its own private user accounts). Finally, because
   this setup requires that each user spawn a private, temporary svnserve
   process, it's equivalent (from a permissions point of view) to allowing
   a group of local users to all access the repository via file:// URLs.
   Path-based access control has no meaning, since each user is accessing
   the repository database files directly.

   Table 6.1, âComparison of subversion server optionsâ provides a quick
   summary of the three typical server deployments.

Choosing a Server Configuration

   So, which server should you use? Which is best?

   Obviously, there's no right answer to that question. Every team has
   different needs, and the different servers all represent different sets
   of trade-offs. The Subversion project itself doesn't endorse one server
   or another, or consider either server more âofficialâ than another.

   Here are some reasons why you might choose one deployment over another,
   as well as reasons you might not choose one.

The svnserve Server

   Why you might want to use it:

          + Quick and easy to set up.
          + Network protocol is stateful and noticeably faster than
            WebDAV.
          + No need to create system accounts on server.
          + Password is not passed over the network.

   Why you might want to avoid it:

          + By default, only one authentication method is available, the
            network protocol is not encrypted, and the server stores clear
            text passwords. (All these things can be changed by
            configuring SASL, but it's a bit more work to do.)
          + No logging of any kind, not even errors.
          + No built-in web browsing. (You'd have to install a separate
            web server and repository browsing software to add this.)

svnserve over SSH

   Why you might want to use it:

          + The network protocol is stateful and noticeably faster than
            WebDAV.
          + You can take advantage of existing SSH accounts and user
            infrastructure.
          + All network traffic is encrypted.

   Why you might want to avoid it:

          + Only one choice of authentication method is available.
          + There is no logging of any kind, not even errors.
          + It requires users to be in the same system group, or use a
            shared SSH key.
          + If used improperly, it can lead to file permission problems.

The Apache HTTP Server

   Why you might want to use it:

          + It allows Subversion to use any of the numerous authentication
            systems already integrated with Apache.
          + There is no need to create system accounts on the server.
          + Full Apache logging is available.
          + Network traffic can be encrypted via SSL.
          + HTTP(S) can usually go through corporate firewalls.
          + Built-in repository browsing is available via web browser.
          + The repository can be mounted as a network drive for
            transparent version control (see the section called
            âAutoversioningâ).

   Why you might want to avoid it:

          + Noticeably slower than svnserve, because HTTP is a stateless
            protocol and requires more network turnarounds.
          + Initial setup can be complex.

Recommendations

   In general, the authors of this book recommend a vanilla svnserve
   installation for small teams just trying to get started with a
   Subversion server; it's the simplest to set up and has the fewest
   maintenance issues. You can always switch to a more complex server
   deployment as your needs change.

   Here are some general recommendations and tips, based on years of
   supporting users:
     * If you're trying to set up the simplest possible server for your
       group, a vanilla svnserve installation is the easiest, fastest
       route. Note, however, that your repository data will be transmitted
       in the clear over the network. If your deployment is entirely
       within your company's LAN or VPN, this isn't an issue. If the
       repository is exposed to the wide-open Internet, you might want to
       make sure that either the repository's contents aren't sensitive
       (e.g., it contains only open source code), or that you go the extra
       mile in configuring SASL to encrypt network communications.
     * If you need to integrate with existing legacy identity systems
       (LDAP, Active Directory, NTLM, X.509, etc.), you must use either
       the Apache-based server or svnserve configured with SASL. If you
       absolutely need server-side logs of either server errors or client
       activities, an Apache-based server is your only option.
     * If you've decided to use either Apache or stock svnserve, create a
       single svn user on your system and run the server process as that
       user. Be sure to make the repository directory wholly owned by the
       svn user as well. From a security point of view, this keeps the
       repository data nicely siloed and protected by operating system
       filesystem permissions, changeable by only the Subversion server
       process itself.
     * If you have an existing infrastructure that is heavily based on SSH
       accounts, and if your users already have system accounts on your
       server machine, it makes sense to deploy an svnserve-over-SSH
       solution. Otherwise, we don't widely recommend this option to the
       public. It's generally considered safer to have your users access
       the repository via (imaginary) accounts managed by svnserve or
       Apache, rather than by full-blown system accounts. If your deep
       desire for encrypted communication still draws you to this option,
       we recommend using Apache with SSL or svnserve with SASL encryption
       instead.
     * Do not be seduced by the simple idea of having all of your users
       access a repository directly via file:// URLs. Even if the
       repository is readily available to everyone via a network share,
       this is a bad idea. It removes any layers of protection between the
       users and the repository: users can accidentally (or intentionally)
       corrupt the repository database, it becomes hard to take the
       repository offline for inspection or upgrade, and it can lead to a
       mess of file permission problems (see the section called
       âSupporting Multiple Repository Access Methodsâ). Note that this is
       also one of the reasons we warn against accessing repositories via
       svn+ssh:// URLsâfrom a security standpoint, it's effectively the
       same as local users accessing via file://, and it can entail all
       the same problems if the administrator isn't careful.

svnserve, a Custom Server

   The svnserve program is a lightweight server, capable of speaking to
   clients over TCP/IP using a custom, stateful protocol. Clients contact
   an svnserve server by using URLs that begin with the svn:// or
   svn+ssh:// scheme. This section will explain the different ways of
   running svnserve, how clients authenticate themselves to the server,
   and how to configure appropriate access control to your repositories.

Invoking the Server

   There are a few different ways to run the svnserve program:
     * Run svnserve as a standalone daemon, listening for requests.
     * Have the Unix inetd daemon temporarily spawn svnserve whenever a
       request comes in on a certain port.
     * Have SSH invoke a temporary svnserve over an encrypted tunnel.
     * Run svnserve as a Microsoft Windows service.

svnserve as daemon

   The easiest option is to run svnserve as a standalone âdaemonâ process.
   Use the -d option for this:
$ svnserve -d
$               # svnserve is now running, listening on port 3690

   When running svnserve in daemon mode, you can use the --listen-port and
   --listen-host options to customize the exact port and hostname to
   âbindâ to.

   Once we successfully start svnserve as explained previously, it makes
   every repository on your system available to the network. A client
   needs to specify an absolute path in the repository URL. For example,
   if a repository is located at /var/svn/project1, a client would reach
   it via svn://host.example.com/var/svn/project1. To increase security,
   you can pass the -r option to svnserve, which restricts it to exporting
   only repositories below that path. For example:
$ svnserve -d -r /var/svn
â¦

   Using the -r option effectively modifies the location that the program
   treats as the root of the remote filesystem space. Clients then use
   URLs that have that path portion removed from them, leaving much
   shorter (and much less revealing) URLs:
$ svn checkout svn://host.example.com/project1
â¦

svnserve via inetd

   If you want inetd to launch the process, you need to pass the -i
   (--inetd) option. In the following example, we've shown the output from
   running svnserve -i at the command line, but note that this isn't how
   you actually start the daemon; see the paragraphs following the example
   for how to configure inetd to start svnserve.
$ svnserve -i
( success ( 1 2 ( ANONYMOUS ) ( edit-pipeline ) ) )

   When invoked with the --inetd option, svnserve attempts to speak with a
   Subversion client via stdin and stdout using a custom protocol. This is
   the standard behavior for a program being run via inetd. The IANA has
   reserved port 3690 for the Subversion protocol, so on a Unix-like
   system you can add lines to /etc/services such as these (if they don't
   already exist):
svn           3690/tcp   # Subversion
svn           3690/udp   # Subversion

   If your system is using a classic Unix-like inetd daemon, you can add
   this line to /etc/inetd.conf:
svn stream tcp nowait svnowner /usr/bin/svnserve svnserve -i

   Make sure âsvnownerâ is a user that has appropriate permissions to
   access your repositories. Now, when a client connection comes into your
   server on port 3690, inetd will spawn an svnserve process to service
   it. Of course, you may also want to add -r to the configuration line as
   well, to restrict which repositories are exported.

svnserve over a tunnel

   A third way to invoke svnserve is in tunnel mode, using the -t option.
   This mode assumes that a remote-service program such as rsh or ssh has
   successfully authenticated a user and is now invoking a private
   svnserve process as that user. (Note that you, the user, will rarely,
   if ever, have reason to invoke svnserve with the -t at the command
   line; instead, the SSH daemon does so for you.) The svnserve program
   behaves normally (communicating via stdin and stdout) and assumes that
   the traffic is being automatically redirected over some sort of tunnel
   back to the client. When svnserve is invoked by a tunnel agent like
   this, be sure that the authenticated user has full read and write
   access to the repository database files. It's essentially the same as a
   local user accessing the repository via file:// URLs.

   This option is described in much more detail later in this chapter in
   the section called âTunneling over SSHâ.

svnserve as Windows service

   If your Windows system is a descendant of Windows NT (2000, 2003, XP,
   or Vista), you can run svnserve as a standard Windows service. This is
   typically a much nicer experience than running it as a standalone
   daemon with the --daemon (-d) option. Using daemon mode requires
   launching a console, typing a command, and then leaving the console
   window running indefinitely. A Windows service, however, runs in the
   background, can start at boot time automatically, and can be started
   and stopped using the same consistent administration interface as other
   Windows services.

   You'll need to define the new service using the command-line tool
   SC.EXE. Much like the inetd configuration line, you must specify an
   exact invocation of svnserve for Windows to run at startup time:
C:\> sc create svn
        binpath= "C:\svn\bin\svnserve.exe --service -r C:\repos"
        displayname= "Subversion Server"
        depend= Tcpip
        start= auto

   This defines a new Windows service named âsvn,â which executes a
   particular svnserve.exe command when started (in this case, rooted at
   C:\repos). There are a number of caveats in the prior example, however.

   First, notice that the svnserve.exe program must always be invoked with
   the --service option. Any other options to svnserve must then be
   specified on the same line, but you cannot add conflicting options such
   as --daemon (-d), --tunnel, or --inetd (-i). Options such as -r or
   --listen-port are fine, though. Second, be careful about spaces when
   invoking the SC.EXE command: the key= value patterns must have no
   spaces between key= and must have exactly one space before the value.
   Lastly, be careful about spaces in your command line to be invoked. If
   a directory name contains spaces (or other characters that need
   escaping), place the entire inner value of binpath in double quotes, by
   escaping them:
C:\> sc create svn
        binpath= "\"C:\program files\svn\bin\svnserve.exe\" --service -r C:\rep
os"
        displayname= "Subversion Server"
        depend= Tcpip
        start= auto

   Also note that the word binpath is misleadingâits value is a command
   line, not the path to an executable. That's why you need to surround it
   with quotes if it contains embedded spaces.

   Once the service is defined, it can be stopped, started, or queried
   using standard GUI tools (the Services administrative control panel),
   or at the command line:
C:\> net stop svn
C:\> net start svn

   The service can also be uninstalled (i.e., undefined) by deleting its
   definition: sc delete svn. Just be sure to stop the service first! The
   SC.EXE program has many other subcommands and options; run sc /? to
   learn more about it.

Built-in Authentication and Authorization

   When a client connects to an svnserve process, the following things
   happen:
     * The client selects a specific repository.
     * The server processes the repository's conf/svnserve.conf file and
       begins to enforce any authentication and authorization policies it
       describes.
     * Depending on the defined policies, one of the following may occur:
          + The client may be allowed to make requests anonymously,
            without ever receiving an authentication challenge.
          + The client may be challenged for authentication at any time.
          + If operating in tunnel mode, the client will declare itself to
            be already externally authenticated (typically by SSH).

   The svnserve server, by default, knows only how to send a CRAM-MD5
   ^[41] authentication challenge. In essence, the server sends a small
   amount of data to the client. The client uses the MD5 hash algorithm to
   create a fingerprint of the data and password combined, and then sends
   the fingerprint as a response. The server performs the same computation
   with the stored password to verify that the result is identical. At no
   point does the actual password travel over the network.

   If your svnserve server was built with SASL support, it not only knows
   how to send CRAM-MD5 challenges, but also likely knows a whole host of
   other authentication mechanisms. See the section called âUsing svnserve
   with SASLâ later in this chapter to learn how to configure SASL
   authentication and encryption.

   It's also possible, of course, for the client to be externally
   authenticated via a tunnel agent, such as ssh. In that case, the server
   simply examines the user it's running as, and uses this name as the
   authenticated username. For more on this, see the later section, the
   section called âTunneling over SSHâ.

   As you've already guessed, a repository's svnserve.conf file is the
   central mechanism for controlling authentication and authorization
   policies. The file has the same format as other configuration files
   (see the section called âRuntime Configuration Areaâ): section names
   are marked by square brackets ([ and ]), comments begin with hashes
   (#), and each section contains specific variables that can be set
   (variable = value). Let's walk through these files and learn how to use
   them.

Create a users file and realm

   For now, the [general] section of svnserve.conf has all the variables
   you need. Begin by changing the values of those variables: choose a
   name for a file that will contain your usernames and passwords and
   choose an authentication realm:
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

   The realm is a name that you define. It tells clients which sort of
   âauthentication namespaceâ they're connecting to; the Subversion client
   displays it in the authentication prompt and uses it as a key (along
   with the server's hostname and port) for caching credentials on disk
   (see the section called âClient Credentials Cachingâ). The password-db
   variable points to a separate file that contains a list of usernames
   and passwords, using the same familiar format. For example:
[users]
harry = foopassword
sally = barpassword

   The value of password-db can be an absolute or relative path to the
   users file. For many admins, it's easy to keep the file right in the
   conf/ area of the repository, alongside svnserve.conf. On the other
   hand, it's possible you may want to have two or more repositories share
   the same users file; in that case, the file should probably live in a
   more public place. The repositories sharing the users file should also
   be configured to have the same realm, since the list of users
   essentially defines an authentication realm. Wherever the file lives,
   be sure to set the file's read and write permissions appropriately. If
   you know which user(s) svnserve will run as, restrict read access to
   the users file as necessary.

Set access controls

   There are two more variables to set in the svnserve.conf file: they
   determine what unauthenticated (anonymous) and authenticated users are
   allowed to do. The variables anon-access and auth-access can be set to
   the value none, read, or write. Setting the value to none prohibits
   both reading and writing; read allows read-only access to the
   repository, and write allows complete read/write access to the
   repository. For example:
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# anonymous users can only read the repository
anon-access = read

# authenticated users can both read and write
auth-access = write

   The example settings are, in fact, the default values of the variables,
   should you forget to define them. If you want to be even more
   conservative, you can block anonymous access completely:
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# anonymous users aren't allowed
anon-access = none

# authenticated users can both read and write
auth-access = write

   The server process understands not only these âblanketâ access controls
   to the repository, but also finer-grained access restrictions placed on
   specific files and directories within the repository. To make use of
   this feature, you need to define a file containing more detailed rules,
   and then set the authz-db variable to point to it:
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# Specific access rules for specific locations
authz-db = authzfile

   We discuss the syntax of the authzfile file in detail later in this
   chapter, in the section called âPath-Based Authorizationâ. Note that
   the authz-db variable isn't mutually exclusive with the anon-access and
   auth-access variables; if all the variables are defined at once, all of
   the rules must be satisfied before access is allowed.

Using svnserve with SASL

   For many teams, the built-in CRAM-MD5 authentication is all they need
   from svnserve. However, if your server (and your Subversion clients)
   were built with the Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer
   (SASL) library, you have a number of authentication and encryption
   options available to you.

   What Is SASL?

   The Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer is open source
   software written by Carnegie Mellon University. It adds generic
   authentication and encryption capabilities to any network protocol, and
   as of Subversion 1.5 and later, both the svnserve server and svn client
   know how to make use of this library. It may or may not be available to
   you: if you're building Subversion yourself, you'll need to have at
   least version 2.1 of SASL installed on your system, and you'll need to
   make sure that it's detected during Subversion's build process. If
   you're using a prebuilt Subversion binary package, you'll have to check
   with the package maintainer as to whether SASL support was compiled in.
   SASL comes with a number of pluggable modules that represent different
   authentication systems: Kerberos (GSSAPI), NTLM, One-Time-Passwords
   (OTP), DIGEST-MD5, LDAP, Secure-Remote-Password (SRP), and others.
   Certain mechanisms may or may not be available to you; be sure to check
   which modules are provided.

   You can download Cyrus SASL (both code and documentation) from
   http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html.

   Normally, when a subversion client connects to svnserve, the server
   sends a greeting that advertises a list of the capabilities it
   supports, and the client responds with a similar list of capabilities.
   If the server is configured to require authentication, it then sends a
   challenge that lists the authentication mechanisms available; the
   client responds by choosing one of the mechanisms, and then
   authentication is carried out in some number of round-trip messages.
   Even when SASL capabilities aren't present, the client and server
   inherently know how to use the CRAM-MD5 and ANONYMOUS mechanisms (see
   the section called âBuilt-in Authentication and Authorizationâ). If
   server and client were linked against SASL, a number of other
   authentication mechanisms may also be available. However, you'll need
   to explicitly configure SASL on the server side to advertise them.

Authenticating with SASL

   To activate specific SASL mechanisms on the server, you'll need to do
   two things. First, create a [sasl] section in your repository's
   svnserve.conf file with an initial key-value pair:
          [sasl]
          use-sasl = true

   Second, create a main SASL configuration file called svn.conf in a
   place where the SASL library can find itâtypically in the directory
   where SASL plug-ins are located. You'll have to locate the plug-in
   directory on your particular system, such as /usr/lib/sasl2/ or
   /etc/sasl2/. (Note that this is not the svnserve.conf file that lives
   within a repository!)

   On a Windows server, you'll also have to edit the system registry
   (using a tool such as regedit) to tell SASL where to find things.
   Create a registry key named [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Carnegie
   Mellon\Project Cyrus\SASL Library], and place two keys inside it: a key
   called SearchPath (whose value is a path to the directory containing
   the SASL sasl*.dll plug-in libraries), and a key called ConfFile (whose
   value is a path to the parent directory containing the svn.conf file
   you created).

   Because SASL provides so many different kinds of authentication
   mechanisms, it would be foolish (and far beyond the scope of this book)
   to try to describe every possible server-side configuration. Instead,
   we recommend that you read the documentation supplied in the doc/
   subdirectory of the SASL source code. It goes into great detail about
   every mechanism and how to configure the server appropriately for each.
   For the purposes of this discussion, we'll just demonstrate a simple
   example of configuring the DIGEST-MD5 mechanism. For example, if your
   subversion.conf (or svn.conf) file contains the following:
pwcheck_method: auxprop
auxprop_plugin: sasldb
sasldb_path: /etc/my_sasldb
mech_list: DIGEST-MD5

   you've told SASL to advertise the DIGEST-MD5 mechanism to clients and
   to check user passwords against a private password database located at
   /etc/my_sasldb. A system administrator can then use the saslpasswd2
   program to add or modify usernames and passwords in the database:
$ saslpasswd2 -c -f /etc/my_sasldb -u realm username

   A few words of warning: first, make sure the ârealmâ argument to
   saslpasswd2 matches the same realm you've defined in your repository's
   svnserve.conf file; if they don't match, authentication will fail.
   Also, due to a shortcoming in SASL, the common realm must be a string
   with no space characters. Finally, if you decide to go with the
   standard SASL password database, make sure the svnserve program has
   read access to the file (and possibly write access as well, if you're
   using a mechanism such as OTP).

   This is just one simple way of configuring SASL. Many other
   authentication mechanisms are available, and passwords can be stored in
   other places such as in LDAP or a SQL database. Consult the full SASL
   documentation for details.

   Remember that if you configure your server to only allow certain SASL
   authentication mechanisms, this forces all connecting clients to have
   SASL support as well. Any Subversion client built without SASL support
   (which includes all pre-1.5 clients) will be unable to authenticate. On
   the one hand, this sort of restriction may be exactly what you want
   (âMy clients must all use Kerberos!â). However, if you still want
   non-SASL clients to be able to authenticate, be sure to advertise the
   CRAM-MD5 mechanism as an option. All clients are able to use CRAM-MD5,
   whether they have SASL capabilities or not.

SASL encryption

   SASL is also able to perform data encryption if a particular mechanism
   supports it. The built-in CRAM-MD5 mechanism doesn't support
   encryption, but DIGEST-MD5 does, and mechanisms such as SRP actually
   require use of the OpenSSL library. To enable or disable different
   levels of encryption, you can set two values in your repository's
   svnserve.conf file:
[sasl]
use-sasl = true
min-encryption = 128
max-encryption = 256

   The min-encryption and max-encryption variables control the level of
   encryption demanded by the server. To disable encryption completely,
   set both values to 0. To enable simple checksumming of data (i.e.,
   prevent tampering and guarantee data integrity without encryption), set
   both values to 1. If you wish to allowâbut not requireâencryption, set
   the minimum value to 0, and the maximum value to some bit length. To
   require encryption unconditionally, set both values to numbers greater
   than 1. In our previous example, we require clients to do at least
   128-bit encryption, but no more than 256-bit encryption.

Tunneling over SSH

   svnserve's built-in authentication (and SASL support) can be very
   handy, because it avoids the need to create real system accounts. On
   the other hand, some administrators already have well-established SSH
   authentication frameworks in place. In these situations, all of the
   project's users already have system accounts and the ability to âSSH
   intoâ the server machine.

   It's easy to use SSH in conjunction with svnserve. The client simply
   uses the svn+ssh:// URL scheme to connect:
$ whoami
harry

$ svn list svn+ssh://host.example.com/repos/project
harryssh@host.example.com's password:  *****

foo
bar
baz
â¦

   In this example, the Subversion client is invoking a local ssh process,
   connecting to host.example.com, authenticating as the user harryssh
   (according to SSH user configuration), then spawning a private svnserve
   process on the remote machine running as the user harryssh. The
   svnserve command is being invoked in tunnel mode (-t), and its network
   protocol is being âtunneledâ over the encrypted connection by ssh, the
   tunnel agent. If the client performs a commit, the authenticated
   username harryssh will be used as the author of the new revision.

   The important thing to understand here is that the Subversion client is
   not connecting to a running svnserve daemon. This method of access
   doesn't require a daemon, nor does it notice one if present. It relies
   wholly on the ability of ssh to spawn a temporary svnserve process,
   which then terminates when the network connection is closed.

   When using svn+ssh:// URLs to access a repository, remember that it's
   the ssh program prompting for authentication, and not the svn client
   program. That means there's no automatic password-caching going on (see
   the section called âClient Credentials Cachingâ). The Subversion client
   often makes multiple connections to the repository, though users don't
   normally notice this due to the password caching feature. When using
   svn+ssh:// URLs, however, users may be annoyed by ssh repeatedly asking
   for a password for every outbound connection. The solution is to use a
   separate SSH password-caching tool such as ssh-agent on a Unix-like
   system, or pageant on Windows.

   When running over a tunnel, authorization is primarily controlled by
   operating system permissions to the repository's database files; it's
   very much the same as if Harry were accessing the repository directly
   via a file:// URL. If multiple system users are going to be accessing
   the repository directly, you may want to place them into a common
   group, and you'll need to be careful about umasks (be sure to read the
   section called âSupporting Multiple Repository Access Methodsâ later in
   this chapter). But even in the case of tunneling, you can still use the
   svnserve.conf file to block access, by simply setting auth-access =
   read or auth-access = none. ^[42]

   You'd think that the story of SSH tunneling would end here, but it
   doesn't. Subversion allows you to create custom tunnel behaviors in
   your runtime config file (see the section called âRuntime Configuration
   Areaâ.) For example, suppose you want to use RSH instead of SSH. ^[43]
   In the [tunnels] section of your config file, simply define it like
   this:
[tunnels]
rsh = rsh

   And now, you can use this new tunnel definition by using a URL scheme
   that matches the name of your new variable: svn+rsh://host/path. When
   using the new URL scheme, the Subversion client will actually be
   running the command rsh host svnserve -t behind the scenes. If you
   include a username in the URL (e.g., svn+rsh://username@host/path), the
   client will also include that in its command (rsh username@host
   svnserve -t). But you can define new tunneling schemes to be much more
   clever than that:
[tunnels]
joessh = $JOESSH /opt/alternate/ssh -p 29934

   This example demonstrates a couple of things. First, it shows how to
   make the Subversion client launch a very specific tunneling binary (the
   one located at /opt/alternate/ssh) with specific options. In this case,
   accessing an svn+joessh:// URL would invoke the particular SSH binary
   with -p 29934 as argumentsâuseful if you want the tunnel program to
   connect to a nonstandard port.

   Second, it shows how to define a custom environment variable that can
   override the name of the tunneling program. Setting the SVN_SSH
   environment variable is a convenient way to override the default SSH
   tunnel agent. But if you need to have several different overrides for
   different servers, each perhaps contacting a different port or passing
   a different set of options to SSH, you can use the mechanism
   demonstrated in this example. Now if we were to set the JOESSH
   environment variable, its value would override the entire value of the
   tunnel variableâ$JOESSH would be executed instead of /opt/alternate/ssh
   -p 29934.

SSH configuration tricks

   It's possible to control not only the way in which the client invokes
   ssh, but also to control the behavior of sshd on your server machine.
   In this section, we'll show how to control the exact svnserve command
   executed by sshd, as well as how to have multiple users share a single
   system account.

Initial setup

   To begin, locate the home directory of the account you'll be using to
   launch svnserve. Make sure the account has an SSH public/private
   keypair installed, and that the user can log in via public-key
   authentication. Password authentication will not work, since all of the
   following SSH tricks revolve around using the SSH authorized_keys file.

   If it doesn't already exist, create the authorized_keys file (on Unix,
   typically ~/.ssh/authorized_keys). Each line in this file describes a
   public key that is allowed to connect. The lines are typically of the
   form:
  ssh-dsa AAAABtce9euchâ¦ user@example.com

   The first field describes the type of key, the second field is the
   base64-encoded key itself, and the third field is a comment. However,
   it's a lesser known fact that the entire line can be preceded by a
   command field:
  command="program" ssh-dsa AAAABtce9euchâ¦ user@example.com

   When the command field is set, the SSH daemon will run the named
   program instead of the typical tunnel-mode svnserve invocation that the
   Subversion client asks for. This opens the door to a number of
   server-side tricks. In the following examples, we abbreviate the lines
   of the file as:
  command="program" TYPE KEY COMMENT

Controlling the invoked command

   Because we can specify the executed server-side command, it's easy to
   name a specific svnserve binary to run and to pass it extra arguments:
  command="/path/to/svnserve -t -r /virtual/root" TYPE KEY COMMENT

   In this example, /path/to/svnserve might be a custom wrapper script
   around svnserve which sets the umask (see the section called
   âSupporting Multiple Repository Access Methodsâ.) It also shows how to
   anchor svnserve in a virtual root directory, just as one often does
   when running svnserve as a daemon process. This might be done either to
   restrict access to parts of the system, or simply to relieve the user
   of having to type an absolute path in the svn+ssh:// URL.

   It's also possible to have multiple users share a single account.
   Instead of creating a separate system account for each user, generate a
   public/private key pair for each person. Then place each public key
   into the authorized_users file, one per line, and use the --tunnel-user
   option:
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=harry" TYPE1 KEY1 harry@example.com
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=sally" TYPE2 KEY2 sally@example.com

   This example allows both Harry and Sally to connect to the same account
   via public key authentication. Each of them has a custom command that
   will be executed; the --tunnel-user option tells svnserve to assume
   that the named argument is the authenticated user. Without
   --tunnel-user, it would appear as though all commits were coming from
   the one shared system account.

   A final word of caution: giving a user access to the server via
   public-key in a shared account might still allow other forms of SSH
   access, even if you've set the command value in authorized_keys. For
   example, the user may still get shell access through SSH or be able to
   perform X11 or general port forwarding through your server. To give the
   user as little permission as possible, you may want to specify a number
   of restrictive options immediately after the command:
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=harry",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forw
arding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty TYPE1 KEY1 harry@example.com

   Note that this all must be on one lineâtruly on one lineâsince SSH
   authorized_keys files do not even allow the conventional backslash
   character (\) for line continuation. The only reason we've shown it
   with a line break is to fit it on the physical page of a book.

httpd, the Apache HTTP Server

   The Apache HTTP Server is a âheavy-dutyâ network server that Subversion
   can leverage. Via a custom module, httpd makes Subversion repositories
   available to clients via the WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, which is an
   extension to HTTP 1.1 (see http://www.webdav.org/ for more
   information). This protocol takes the ubiquitous HTTP protocol that is
   the core of the World Wide Web, and adds writingâspecifically,
   versioned writingâcapabilities. The result is a standardized, robust
   system that is conveniently packaged as part of the Apache 2.0
   software, supported by numerous operating systems and third-party
   products, and doesn't require network administrators to open up yet
   another custom port. ^[44] While an Apache-Subversion server has more
   features than svnserve, it's also a bit more difficult to set up. With
   flexibility often comes more complexity.

   Much of the following discussion includes references to Apache
   configuration directives. While some examples are given of the use of
   these directives, describing them in full is outside the scope of this
   chapter. The Apache team maintains excellent documentation, publicly
   available on their web site at http://httpd.apache.org. For example, a
   general reference for the configuration directives is located at
   http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/directives.html.

   Also, as you make changes to your Apache setup, it is likely that
   somewhere along the way a mistake will be made. If you are not already
   familiar with Apache's logging subsystem, you should become aware of
   it. In your httpd.conf file are directives that specify the on-disk
   locations of the access and error logs generated by Apache (the
   CustomLog and ErrorLog directives, respectively). Subversion's
   mod_dav_svn uses Apache's error logging interface as well. You can
   always browse the contents of those files for information that might
   reveal the source of a problem that is not clearly noticeable
   otherwise.

   Why Apache 2?

   If you're a system administrator, it's very likely that you're already
   running the Apache web server and have some prior experience with it.
   At the time of this writing, Apache 1.3 is the more popular version of
   Apache. The world has been somewhat slow to upgrade to the Apache 2.x
   series for various reasons: some people fear change, especially
   changing something as critical as a web server. Other people depend on
   plug-in modules that work only against the Apache 1.3 API, and they are
   waiting for a 2.x port. Whatever the reason, many people begin to worry
   when they first discover that Subversion's Apache module is written
   specifically for the Apache 2 API.

   The proper response to this problem is: don't worry about it. It's easy
   to run Apache 1.3 and Apache 2 side by side; simply install them to
   separate places and use Apache 2 as a dedicated Subversion server that
   runs on a port other than 80. Clients can access the repository by
   placing the port number into the URL:
$ svn checkout http://host.example.com:7382/repos/project

Prerequisites

   To network your repository over HTTP, you basically need four
   components, available in two packages. You'll need Apache httpd 2.0,
   the mod_dav DAV module that comes with it, Subversion, and the
   mod_dav_svn filesystem provider module distributed with Subversion.
   Once you have all of those components, the process of networking your
   repository is as simple as:
     * Getting httpd 2.0 up and running with the mod_dav module
     * Installing the mod_dav_svn backend to mod_dav, which uses
       Subversion's libraries to access the repository
     * Configuring your httpd.conf file to export (or expose) the
       repository

   You can accomplish the first two items either by compiling httpd and
   Subversion from source code or by installing prebuilt binary packages
   of them on your system. For the most up-to-date information on how to
   compile Subversion for use with the Apache HTTP Server, as well as how
   to compile and configure Apache itself for this purpose, see the
   INSTALL file in the top level of the Subversion source code tree.

Basic Apache Configuration

   Once you have all the necessary components installed on your system,
   all that remains is the configuration of Apache via its httpd.conf
   file. Instruct Apache to load the mod_dav_svn module using the
   LoadModule directive. This directive must precede any other
   Subversion-related configuration items. If your Apache was installed
   using the default layout, your mod_dav_svn module should have been
   installed in the modules subdirectory of the Apache install location
   (often /usr/local/apache2). The LoadModule directive has a simple
   syntax, mapping a named module to the location of a shared library on
   disk:
LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so

   Note that if mod_dav was compiled as a shared object (instead of
   statically linked directly to the httpd binary), you'll need a similar
   LoadModule statement for it, too. Be sure that it comes before the
   mod_dav_svn line:
LoadModule dav_module         modules/mod_dav.so
LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so

   At a later location in your configuration file, you now need to tell
   Apache where you keep your Subversion repository (or repositories). The
   Location directive has an XML-like notation, starting with an opening
   tag and ending with a closing tag, with various other configuration
   directives in the middle. The purpose of the Location directive is to
   instruct Apache to do something special when handling requests that are
   directed at a given URL or one of its children. In the case of
   Subversion, you want Apache to simply hand off support for URLs that
   point at versioned resources to the DAV layer. You can instruct Apache
   to delegate the handling of all URLs whose path portions (the part of
   the URL that follows the server's name and the optional port number)
   begin with /repos/ to a DAV provider whose repository is located at
   /var/svn/repository using the following httpd.conf syntax:
<Location /repos>
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
</Location>

   If you plan to support multiple Subversion repositories that will
   reside in the same parent directory on your local disk, you can use an
   alternative directiveâSVNParentPathâto indicate that common parent
   directory. For example, if you know you will be creating multiple
   Subversion repositories in a directory /var/svn that would be accessed
   via URLs such as http://my.server.com/svn/repos1,
   http://my.server.com/svn/repos2, and so on, you could use the
   httpd.conf configuration syntax in the following example:
<Location /svn>
  DAV svn

  # any "/svn/foo" URL will map to a repository /var/svn/foo
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
</Location>

   Using the previous syntax, Apache will delegate the handling of all
   URLs whose path portions begin with /svn/ to the Subversion DAV
   provider, which will then assume that any items in the directory
   specified by the SVNParentPath directive are actually Subversion
   repositories. This is a particularly convenient syntax in that, unlike
   the use of the SVNPath directive, you don't have to restart Apache to
   create and network new repositories.

   Be sure that when you define your new Location, it doesn't overlap with
   other exported locations. For example, if your main DocumentRoot is
   exported to /www, do not export a Subversion repository in <Location
   /www/repos>. If a request comes in for the URI /www/repos/foo.c, Apache
   won't know whether to look for a file repos/foo.c in the DocumentRoot,
   or whether to delegate mod_dav_svn to return foo.c from the Subversion
   repository. The result is often an error from the server of the form
   301 Moved Permanently.

   Server Names and the COPY Request

   Subversion makes use of the COPY request type to perform server-side
   copies of files and directories. As part of the sanity checking done by
   the Apache modules, the source of the copy is expected to be located on
   the same machine as the destination of the copy. To satisfy this
   requirement, you might need to tell mod_dav the name you use as the
   hostname of your server. Generally, you can use the ServerName
   directive in httpd.conf to accomplish this.
ServerName svn.example.com

   If you are using Apache's virtual hosting support via the
   NameVirtualHost directive, you may need to use the ServerAlias
   directive to specify additional names by which your server is known.
   Again, refer to the Apache documentation for full details.

   At this stage, you should strongly consider the question of
   permissions. If you've been running Apache for some time now as your
   regular web server, you probably already have a collection of
   contentâweb pages, scripts, and such. These items have already been
   configured with a set of permissions that allows them to work with
   Apache, or more appropriately, that allows Apache to work with those
   files. Apache, when used as a Subversion server, will also need the
   correct permissions to read and write to your Subversion repository.

   You will need to determine a permission system setup that satisfies
   Subversion's requirements without messing up any previously existing
   web page or script installations. This might mean changing the
   permissions on your Subversion repository to match those in use by
   other things that Apache serves for you, or it could mean using the
   User and Group directives in httpd.conf to specify that Apache should
   run as the user and group that owns your Subversion repository. There
   is no single correct way to set up your permissions, and each
   administrator will have different reasons for doing things a certain
   way. Just be aware that permission-related problems are perhaps the
   most common oversight when configuring a Subversion repository for use
   with Apache.

Authentication Options

   At this point, if you configured httpd.conf to contain something such
   as the following:
<Location /svn>
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
</Location>

   your repository is âanonymouslyâ accessible to the world. Until you
   configure some authentication and authorization policies, the
   Subversion repositories that you make available via the Location
   directive will be generally accessible to everyone. In other words:
     * Anyone can use a Subversion client to check out a working copy of a
       repository URL (or any of its subdirectories).
     * Anyone can interactively browse the repository's latest revision
       simply by pointing a web browser to the repository URL.
     * Anyone can commit to the repository.

   Of course, you might have already set up a pre-commit hook script to
   prevent commits (see the section called âImplementing Repository
   Hooksâ). But as you read on, you'll see that it's also possible to use
   Apache's built-in methods to restrict access in specific ways.

Setting up HTTP authentication

   The easiest way to authenticate a client is via the HTTP Basic
   authentication mechanism, which simply uses a username and password to
   verify that a user is who she says she is. Apache provides an htpasswd
   utility for managing the list of acceptable usernames and passwords.
   Let's grant commit access to Sally and Harry. First, we need to add
   them to the password file:
$ ### First time: use -c to create the file
$ ### Use -m to use MD5 encryption of the password, which is more secure
$ htpasswd -cm /etc/svn-auth-file harry
New password: *****
Re-type new password: *****
Adding password for user harry
$ htpasswd -m /etc/svn-auth-file sally
New password: *******
Re-type new password: *******
Adding password for user sally
$

   Next, you need to add some more httpd.conf directives inside your
   Location block to tell Apache what to do with your new password file.
   The AuthType directive specifies the type of authentication system to
   use. In this case, we want to specify the Basic authentication system.
   AuthName is an arbitrary name that you give for the authentication
   domain. Most browsers will display this name in the pop-up dialog box
   when the browser is querying the user for her name and password.
   Finally, use the AuthUserFile directive to specify the location of the
   password file you created using htpasswd.

   After adding these three directives, your <Location> block should look
   something like this:
<Location /svn>
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth-file
</Location>

   This <Location> block is not yet complete, and it will not do anything
   useful. It's merely telling Apache that whenever authorization is
   required, Apache should harvest a username and password from the
   Subversion client. What's missing here, however, are directives that
   tell Apache which sorts of client requests require authorization.
   Wherever authorization is required, Apache will demand authentication
   as well. The simplest thing to do is protect all requests. Adding
   Require valid-user tells Apache that all requests require an
   authenticated user:
<Location /svn>
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth-file
  Require valid-user
</Location>

   Be sure to read the next section (the section called âAuthorization
   Optionsâ) for more detail on the Require directive and other ways to
   set authorization policies.

   One word of warning: HTTP Basic Auth passwords pass in very nearly
   plain text over the network, and thus are extremely insecure.

   Another option is to not use Basic authentication, but to use Digest
   authentication instead. Digest authentication allows the server to
   verify the client's identity without passing the plain-text password
   over the network. Assuming that the client and server both know the
   user's password, they can verify that the password is the same by using
   it to apply a hashing function to a one-time bit of information. The
   server sends a small random-ish string to the client; the client uses
   the user's password to hash the string; the server then looks to see
   whether the hashed value is what it expected.

   Configuring Apache for Digest authentication is also fairly easy, and
   only a small variation on our prior example. Be sure to consult
   Apache's documentation for full details.
<Location /svn>
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
  AuthType Digest
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthDigestDomain /svn/
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth-file
  Require valid-user
</Location>

   If you're looking for maximum security, public key cryptography is the
   best solution. It may be best to use some sort of SSL encryption, so
   that clients authenticate via https:// instead of http://; at a bare
   minimum, you can configure Apache to use a self-signed server
   certificate. ^[45] Consult Apache's documentation (and OpenSSL
   documentation) about how to do that.

SSL certificate management

   Businesses that need to expose their repositories for access outside
   the company firewall should be conscious of the possibility that
   unauthorized parties could be âsniffingâ their network traffic. SSL
   makes that kind of unwanted attention less likely to result in
   sensitive data leaks.

   If a Subversion client is compiled to use OpenSSL, it gains the ability
   to speak to an Apache server via https:// URLs. The Neon library used
   by the Subversion client is not only able to verify server
   certificates, but can also supply client certificates when challenged.
   When the client and server have exchanged SSL certificates and
   successfully authenticated one another, all further communication is
   encrypted via a session key.

   It's beyond the scope of this book to describe how to generate client
   and server certificates and how to configure Apache to use them. Many
   other books, including Apache's own documentation, describe this task.
   But what we can cover here is how to manage server and client
   certificates from an ordinary Subversion client.

   When speaking to Apache via https://, a Subversion client can receive
   two different types of information:
     * A server certificate
     * A demand for a client certificate

   If the client receives a server certificate, it needs to verify that it
   trusts the certificate: is the server really who it claims to be? The
   OpenSSL library does this by examining the signer of the server
   certificate, or certificate authority (CA). If OpenSSL is unable to
   automatically trust the CA, or if some other problem occurs (such as an
   expired certificate or hostname mismatch), the Subversion command-line
   client will ask you whether you want to trust the server certificate
   anyway:
$ svn list https://host.example.com/repos/project

Error validating server certificate for 'https://host.example.com:443':
 - The certificate is not issued by a trusted authority. Use the
   fingerprint to validate the certificate manually!
Certificate information:
 - Hostname: host.example.com
 - Valid: from Jan 30 19:23:56 2004 GMT until Jan 30 19:23:56 2006 GMT
 - Issuer: CA, example.com, Sometown, California, US
 - Fingerprint: 7d:e1:a9:34:33:39:ba:6a:e9:a5:c4:22:98:7b:76:5c:92:a0:9c:7b

(R)eject, accept (t)emporarily or accept (p)ermanently?

   This dialogue should look familiar; it's essentially the same question
   you've probably seen coming from your web browser (which is just
   another HTTP client like Subversion). If you choose the (p)ermanent
   option, the server certificate will be cached in your private runtime
   auth/ area in just the same way your username and password are cached
   (see the section called âClient Credentials Cachingâ). If cached,
   Subversion will automatically trust this certificate in future
   negotiations.

   Your runtime servers file also gives you the ability to make your
   Subversion client automatically trust specific CAs, either globally or
   on a per-host basis. Simply set the ssl-authority-files variable to a
   semicolon-separated list of PEM-encoded CA certificates:
[global]
ssl-authority-files = /path/to/CAcert1.pem;/path/to/CAcert2.pem

   Many OpenSSL installations also have a predefined set of âdefaultâ CAs
   that are nearly universally trusted. To make the Subversion client
   automatically trust these standard authorities, set the
   ssl-trust-default-ca variable to true.

   When talking to Apache, a Subversion client might also receive a
   challenge for a client certificate. Apache is asking the client to
   identify itself: is the client really who it says it is? If all goes
   correctly, the Subversion client sends back a private certificate
   signed by a CA that Apache trusts. A client certificate is usually
   stored on disk in encrypted format, protected by a local password. When
   Subversion receives this challenge, it will ask you for a path to the
   certificate and the password that protects it:
$ svn list https://host.example.com/repos/project

Authentication realm: https://host.example.com:443
Client certificate filename: /path/to/my/cert.p12
Passphrase for '/path/to/my/cert.p12':  ********
â¦

   Notice that the client certificate is a âp12â file. To use a client
   certificate with Subversion, it must be in PKCS#12 format, which is a
   portable standard. Most web browsers are already able to import and
   export certificates in that format. Another option is to use the
   OpenSSL command-line tools to convert existing certificates into
   PKCS#12.

   Again, the runtime servers file allows you to automate this challenge
   on a per-host basis. Either or both pieces of information can be
   described in runtime variables:
[groups]
examplehost = host.example.com

[examplehost]
ssl-client-cert-file = /path/to/my/cert.p12
ssl-client-cert-password = somepassword

   Once you've set the ssl-client-cert-file and ssl-client-cert-password
   variables, the Subversion client can automatically respond to a client
   certificate challenge without prompting you. ^[46]

Authorization Options

   At this point, you've configured authentication, but not authorization.
   Apache is able to challenge clients and confirm identities, but it has
   not been told how to allow or restrict access to the clients bearing
   those identities. This section describes two strategies for controlling
   access to your repositories.

Blanket access control

   The simplest form of access control is to authorize certain users for
   either read-only access to a repository or read/write access to a
   repository.

   You can restrict access on all repository operations by adding the
   Require valid-user directive to your <Location> block. Using our
   previous example, this would mean that only clients that claimed to be
   either harry or sally and that provided the correct password for their
   respective username would be allowed to do anything with the Subversion
   repository:
<Location /svn>
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # how to authenticate a user
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /path/to/users/file

  # only authenticated users may access the repository
  Require valid-user
</Location>

   Sometimes you don't need to run such a tight ship. For example,
   Subversion's own source code repository at
   http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn allows anyone in the world to perform
   read-only repository tasks (such as checking out working copies and
   browsing the repository with a web browser), but restricts all write
   operations to authenticated users. To do this type of selective
   restriction, you can use the Limit and LimitExcept configuration
   directives. Like the Location directive, these blocks have starting and
   ending tags, and you would nest them inside your <Location> block.

   The parameters present on the Limit and LimitExcept directives are HTTP
   request types that are affected by that block. For example, if you
   wanted to disallow all access to your repository except the currently
   supported read-only operations, you would use the LimitExcept
   directive, passing the GET, PROPFIND, OPTIONS, and REPORT request type
   parameters. Then the previously mentioned Require valid-user directive
   would be placed inside the <LimitExcept> block instead of just inside
   the <Location> block.
<Location /svn>
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # how to authenticate a user
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /path/to/users/file

  # For any operations other than these, require an authenticated user.
  <LimitExcept GET PROPFIND OPTIONS REPORT>
    Require valid-user
  </LimitExcept>
</Location>

   These are only a few simple examples. For more in-depth information
   about Apache access control and the Require directive, take a look at
   the Security section of the Apache documentation's tutorials collection
   at http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/misc/tutorials.html.

Per-directory access control

   It's possible to set up finer-grained permissions using a second Apache
   httpd module, mod_authz_svn. This module grabs the various opaque URLs
   passing from client to server, asks mod_dav_svn to decode them, and
   then possibly vetoes requests based on access policies defined in a
   configuration file.

   If you've built Subversion from source code, mod_authz_svn is
   automatically built and installed alongside mod_dav_svn. Many binary
   distributions install it automatically as well. To verify that it's
   installed correctly, make sure it comes right after mod_dav_svn's
   LoadModule directive in httpd.conf:
LoadModule dav_module         modules/mod_dav.so
LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
LoadModule authz_svn_module   modules/mod_authz_svn.so

   To activate this module, you need to configure your Location block to
   use the AuthzSVNAccessFile directive, which specifies a file containing
   the permissions policy for paths within your repositories. (In a
   moment, we'll discuss the format of that file.)

   Apache is flexible, so you have the option to configure your block in
   one of three general patterns. To begin, choose one of these basic
   configuration patterns. (The following examples are very simple; look
   at Apache's own documentation for much more detail on Apache
   authentication and authorization options.)

   The simplest block is to allow open access to everyone. In this
   scenario, Apache never sends authentication challenges, so all users
   are treated as âanonymous.â (See Example 6.1, âA sample configuration
   for anonymous accessâ.)

   Example 6.1. A sample configuration for anonymous access
<Location /repos>
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # our access control policy
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/access/file
</Location>

   On the opposite end of the paranoia scale, you can configure your block
   to demand authentication from everyone. All clients must supply
   credentials to identify themselves. Your block unconditionally requires
   authentication via the Require valid-user directive, and it defines a
   means to authenticate. (See Example 6.2, âA sample configuration for
   authenticated accessâ.)

   Example 6.2. A sample configuration for authenticated access
<Location /repos>
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # our access control policy
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/access/file

  # only authenticated users may access the repository
  Require valid-user

  # how to authenticate a user
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /path/to/users/file
</Location>

   A third very popular pattern is to allow a combination of authenticated
   and anonymous access. For example, many administrators want to allow
   anonymous users to read certain repository directories, but want only
   authenticated users to read (or write) more sensitive areas. In this
   setup, all users start out accessing the repository anonymously. If
   your access control policy demands a real username at any point, Apache
   will demand authentication from the client. To do this, use both the
   Satisfy Any and Require valid-user directives together. (See
   Example 6.3, âA sample configuration for mixed authenticated/anonymous
   accessâ.)

   Example 6.3. A sample configuration for mixed authenticated/anonymous
   access
<Location /repos>
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # our access control policy
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/access/file

  # try anonymous access first, resort to real
  # authentication if necessary.
  Satisfy Any
  Require valid-user

  # how to authenticate a user
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /path/to/users/file
</Location>

   Once you've settled on one of these three basic httpd.conf templates,
   you need to create your file containing access rules for particular
   paths within the repository. We describe this later in this chapter, in
   the section called âPath-Based Authorizationâ.

Disabling path-based checks

   The mod_dav_svn module goes through a lot of work to make sure that
   data you've marked âunreadableâ doesn't get accidentally leaked. This
   means it needs to closely monitor all of the paths and file-contents
   returned by commands such as svn checkout and svn update. If these
   commands encounter a path that isn't readable according to some
   authorization policy, the path is typically omitted altogether. In the
   case of history or rename tracingâfor example, running a command such
   as svn cat -r OLD foo.c on a file that was renamed long agoâthe rename
   tracking will simply halt if one of the object's former names is
   determined to be read-restricted.

   All of this path checking can sometimes be quite expensive, especially
   in the case of svn log. When retrieving a list of revisions, the server
   looks at every changed path in each revision and checks it for
   readability. If an unreadable path is discovered, it's omitted from the
   list of the revision's changed paths (normally seen with the --verbose
   option), and the whole log message is suppressed. Needless to say, this
   can be time-consuming on revisions that affect a large number of files.
   This is the cost of security: even if you haven't configured a module
   such as mod_authz_svn at all, the mod_dav_svn module is still asking
   Apache httpd to run authorization checks on every path. The mod_dav_svn
   module has no idea what authorization modules have been installed, so
   all it can do is ask Apache to invoke whatever might be present.

   On the other hand, there's also an escape hatch of sorts, which allows
   you to trade security features for speed. If you're not enforcing any
   sort of per-directory authorization (i.e., not using mod_authz_svn or
   similar module), you can disable all of this path checking. In your
   httpd.conf file, use the SVNPathAuthz directive as shown in
   Example 6.4, âDisabling path checks altogetherâ.

   Example 6.4. Disabling path checks altogether
<Location /repos>
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  SVNPathAuthz off
</Location>

   The SVNPathAuthz directive is âonâ by default. When set to âoff,â all
   path-based authorization checking is disabled; mod_dav_svn stops
   invoking authorization checks on every path it discovers.

Extra Goodies

   We've covered most of the authentication and authorization options for
   Apache and mod_dav_svn. But there are a few other nice features that
   Apache provides.

Repository browsing

   One of the most useful benefits of an Apache/WebDAV configuration for
   your Subversion repository is that the youngest revisions of your
   versioned files and directories are immediately available for viewing
   via a regular web browser. Since Subversion uses URLs to identify
   versioned resources, those URLs used for HTTP-based repository access
   can be typed directly into a web browser. Your browser will issue an
   HTTP GET request for that URL; based on whether that URL represents a
   versioned directory or file, mod_dav_svn will respond with a directory
   listing or with file contents.

   Since the URLs do not contain any information about which version of
   the resource you wish to see, mod_dav_svn will always answer with the
   youngest version. This functionality has the wonderful side effect that
   you can pass around Subversion URLs to your peers as references to
   documents, and those URLs will always point at the latest manifestation
   of that document. Of course, you can even use the URLs as hyperlinks
   from other web sites, too.

   Can I View Older Revisions?

   With an ordinary web browser? In one word: nope. At least, not with
   mod_dav_svn as your only tool.

   Your web browser speaks ordinary HTTP only. That means it knows only
   how to GET public URLs, which represent the latest versions of files
   and directories. According to the WebDAV/DeltaV specification, each
   server defines a private URL syntax for older versions of resources,
   and that syntax is opaque to clients. To find an older version of a
   file, a client must follow a specific procedure to âdiscoverâ the
   proper URL; the procedure involves issuing a series of WebDAV PROPFIND
   requests and understanding DeltaV concepts. This is something your web
   browser simply can't do.

   So, to answer the question, one obvious way to see older revisions of
   files and directories is by passing the --revision (-r) argument to the
   svn list and svn cat commands. To browse old revisions with your web
   browser, however, you can use third-party software. A good example of
   this is ViewVC (http://viewvc.tigris.org/). ViewVC was originally
   written to display CVS repositories through the Web, ^[47] and the
   latest releases are able to understand Subversion repositories as well.

Proper MIME type

   When browsing a Subversion repository, the web browser gets a clue
   about how to render a file's contents by looking at the Content-Type:
   header returned in Apache's response to the HTTP GET request. The value
   of this header is some sort of MIME type. By default, Apache will tell
   the web browsers that all repository files are of the âdefaultâ MIME
   type, typically text/plain. This can be frustrating, however, if a user
   wishes repository files to render as something more meaningfulâfor
   example, it might be nice to have a foo.html file in the repository
   actually render as HTML when browsing.

   To make this happen, you need only to make sure that your files have
   the proper svn:mime-type set. We discuss this in more detail in the
   section called âFile Content Typeâ, and you can even configure your
   client to automatically attach proper svn:mime-type properties to files
   entering the repository for the first time; see the section called
   âAutomatic Property Settingâ.

   So in our example, if one were to set the svn:mime-type property to
   text/html on file foo.html, Apache would properly tell your web browser
   to render the file as HTML. One could also attach proper image/*
   MIME-type properties to image files and ultimately get an entire web
   site to be viewable directly from a repository! There's generally no
   problem with this, as long as the web site doesn't contain any
   dynamically generated content.

Customizing the look

   You generally will get more use out of URLs to versioned filesâafter
   all, that's where the interesting content tends to lie. But you might
   have occasion to browse a Subversion directory listing, where you'll
   quickly note that the generated HTML used to display that listing is
   very basic, and certainly not intended to be aesthetically pleasing (or
   even interesting). To enable customization of these directory displays,
   Subversion provides an XML index feature. A single SVNIndexXSLT
   directive in your repository's Location block of httpd.conf will
   instruct mod_dav_svn to generate XML output when displaying a directory
   listing, and to reference the XSLT stylesheet of your choice:
<Location /svn>
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
  SVNIndexXSLT "/svnindex.xsl"
  â¦
</Location>

   Using the SVNIndexXSLT directive and a creative XSLT stylesheet, you
   can make your directory listings match the color schemes and imagery
   used in other parts of your web site. Or, if you'd prefer, you can use
   the sample stylesheets provided in the Subversion source distribution's
   tools/xslt/ directory. Keep in mind that the path provided to the
   SVNIndexXSLT directory is actually a URL pathâbrowsers need to be able
   to read your stylesheets to make use of them!

Listing repositories

   If you're serving a collection of repositories from a single URL via
   the SVNParentPath directive, then it's also possible to have Apache
   display all available repositories to a web browser. Just activate the
   SVNListParentPath directive:
<Location /svn>
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
  SVNListParentPath on
  â¦
</Location>

   If a user now points her web browser to the URL
   http://host.example.com/svn/, she'll see a list of all Subversion
   repositories sitting in /var/svn. Obviously, this can be a security
   problem, so this feature is turned off by default.

Apache logging

   Because Apache is an HTTP server at heart, it contains fantastically
   flexible logging features. It's beyond the scope of this book to
   discuss all of the ways logging can be configured, but we should point
   out that even the most generic httpd.conf file will cause Apache to
   produce two logs: error_log and access_log. These logs may appear in
   different places, but are typically created in the logging area of your
   Apache installation. (On Unix, they often live in
   /usr/local/apache2/logs/.)

   The error_log describes any internal errors that Apache runs into as it
   works. The access_log file records every incoming HTTP request received
   by Apache. This makes it easy to see, for example, which IP addresses
   Subversion clients are coming from, how often particular clients use
   the server, which users are authenticating properly, and which requests
   succeed or fail.

   Unfortunately, because HTTP is a stateless protocol, even the simplest
   Subversion client operation generates multiple network requests. It's
   very difficult to look at the access_log and deduce what the client was
   doingâmost operations look like a series of cryptic PROPPATCH, GET,
   PUT, and REPORT requests. To make things worse, many client operations
   send nearly identical series of requests, so it's even harder to tell
   them apart.

   mod_dav_svn, however, can come to your aid. By activating an
   âoperational loggingâ feature, you can ask mod_dav_svn to create a
   separate log file describing what sort of high-level operations your
   clients are performing.

   To do this, you need to make use of Apache's CustomLog directive (which
   is explained in more detail in Apache's own documentation). Be sure to
   invoke this directive outside your Subversion Location block:
<Location /svn>
  DAV svn
  â¦
</Location>

CustomLog logs/svn_logfile "%t %u %{SVN-ACTION}e" env=SVN-ACTION

   In this example, we're asking Apache to create a special logfile,
   svn_logfile, in the standard Apache logs directory. The %t and %u
   variables are replaced by the time and username of the request,
   respectively. The really important parts are the two instances of
   SVN-ACTION. When Apache sees that variable, it substitutes the value of
   the SVN-ACTION environment variable, which is automatically set by
   mod_dav_svn whenever it detects a high-level client action.

   So, instead of having to interpret a traditional access_log like this:
[26/Jan/2007:22:25:29 -0600] "PROPFIND /svn/calc/!svn/vcc/default HTTP/1.1" 207
 398
[26/Jan/2007:22:25:29 -0600] "PROPFIND /svn/calc/!svn/bln/59 HTTP/1.1" 207 449
[26/Jan/2007:22:25:29 -0600] "PROPFIND /svn/calc HTTP/1.1" 207 647
[26/Jan/2007:22:25:29 -0600] "REPORT /svn/calc/!svn/vcc/default HTTP/1.1" 200 6
07
[26/Jan/2007:22:25:31 -0600] "OPTIONS /svn/calc HTTP/1.1" 200 188
[26/Jan/2007:22:25:31 -0600] "MKACTIVITY /svn/calc/!svn/act/e6035ef7-5df0-4ac0-
b811-4be7c823f998 HTTP/1.1" 201 227
â¦

   you can peruse a much more intelligible svn_logfile like this:
[26/Jan/2007:22:24:20 -0600] - get-dir /tags r1729 props
[26/Jan/2007:22:24:27 -0600] - update /trunk r1729 depth=infinity send-copyfrom
-args
[26/Jan/2007:22:25:29 -0600] - status /trunk/foo r1729 depth=infinity
[26/Jan/2007:22:25:31 -0600] sally commit r1730

   For an exhaustive list of all actions logged, see the section called
   âHigh-level loggingâ.

Write-through proxying

   One of the nice advantages of using Apache as a Subversion server is
   that it can be set up for simple replication. For example, suppose that
   your team is distributed across four offices around the globe. The
   Subversion repository can exist only in one of those offices, which
   means the other three offices will not enjoy accessing itâthey're
   likely to experience significantly slower traffic and response times
   when updating and committing code. A powerful solution is to set up a
   system consisting of one master Apache server and several slave Apache
   servers. If you place a slave server in each office, users can check
   out a working copy from whichever slave is closest to them. All read
   requests go to their local slave. Write requests get automatically
   routed to the single master server. When the commit completes, the
   master then automatically âpushesâ the new revision to each slave
   server using the svnsync replication tool.

   This configuration creates a huge perceptual speed increase for your
   users, because Subversion client traffic is typically 80â90% read
   requests. And if those requests are coming from a local server, it's a
   huge win.

   In this section, we'll walk you through a standard setup of this
   single-master/multiple-slave system. However, keep in mind that your
   servers must be running at least Apache 2.2.0 (with mod_proxy loaded)
   and Subversion 1.5 (mod_dav_svn).

Configure the servers

   First, configure your master server's httpd.conf file in the usual way.
   Make the repository available at a certain URI location, and configure
   authentication and authorization however you'd like. After that's done,
   configure each of your âslaveâ servers in the exact same way, but add
   the special SVNMasterURI directive to the block:
<Location /svn>
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repos
  SVNMasterURI http://master.example.com/svn
  â¦
</Location>

   This new directive tells a slave server to redirect all write requests
   to the master. (This is done automatically via Apache's mod_proxy
   module.) Ordinary read requests, however, are still serviced by the
   slaves. Be sure that your master and slave servers all have matching
   authentication and authorization configurations; if they fall out of
   sync, it can lead to big headaches.

   Next, we need to deal with the problem of infinite recursion. With the
   current configuration, imagine what will happen when a Subversion
   client performs a commit to the master server. After the commit
   completes, the server uses svnsync to replicate the new revision to
   each slave. But because svnsync appears to be just another Subversion
   client performing a commit, the slave will immediately attempt to proxy
   the incoming write request back to the master! Hilarity ensues.

   The solution to this problem is to have the master push revisions to a
   different <Location> on the slaves. This location is configured to not
   proxy write requests at all, but to accept normal commits from (and
   only from) the master's IP address:
<Location /svn-proxy-sync>
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repos
  Order deny,allow
  Deny from all
  # Only let the server's IP address access this Location:
  Allow from 10.20.30.40
  â¦
</Location>

Set up replication

   Now that you've configured your Location blocks on master and slaves,
   you need to configure the master to replicate to the slaves. This is
   done the usual wayâ using svnsync. If you're not familiar with this
   tool, see the section called âRepository Replicationâ for details.

   First, make sure that each slave repository has a pre-revprop-change
   hook script which allows remote revision property changes. (This is
   standard procedure for being on the receiving end of svnsync.) Then log
   into the master server and configure each of the slave repository URIs
   to receive data from the master repository on the local disk:
$ svnsync init http://slave1.example.com/svn-proxy-sync file://var/svn/repos
Copied properties for revision 0.
$ svnsync init http://slave2.example.com/svn-proxy-sync file://var/svn/repos
Copied properties for revision 0.
$ svnsync init http://slave3.example.com/svn-proxy-sync file://var/svn/repos
Copied properties for revision 0.

# Perform the initial replication

$ svnsync sync http://slave1.example.com/svn-proxy-sync
Transmitting file data ....
Committed revision 1.
Copied properties for revision 1.
Transmitting file data .......
Committed revision 2.
Copied properties for revision 2.
â¦

$ svnsync sync http://slave2.example.com/svn-proxy-sync
Transmitting file data ....
Committed revision 1.
Copied properties for revision 1.
Transmitting file data .......
Committed revision 2.
Copied properties for revision 2.
â¦

$ svnsync sync http://slave3.example.com/svn-proxy-sync
Transmitting file data ....
Committed revision 1.
Copied properties for revision 1.
Transmitting file data .......
Committed revision 2.
Copied properties for revision 2.
â¦

   After this is done, we configure the master server's post-commit hook
   script to invoke svnsync on each slave server:
#!/bin/sh
# Post-commit script to replicate newly committed revision to slaves

svnsync sync http://slave1.example.com/svn-proxy-sync > /dev/null 2>&1
svnsync sync http://slave2.example.com/svn-proxy-sync > /dev/null 2>&1
svnsync sync http://slave3.example.com/svn-proxy-sync > /dev/null 2>&1

   The extra bits on the end of each line aren't necessary, but they're a
   sneaky way to allow the sync commands to run in the background so that
   the Subversion client isn't left waiting forever for the commit to
   finish. In addition to this post-commit hook, you'll need a
   post-revprop-change hook as well so that when a user, say, modifies a
   log message, the slave servers get that change also:
#!/bin/sh
# Post-revprop-change script to replicate revprop-changes to slaves

REV=${2}
svnsync copy-revprops http://slave1.example.com/svn-proxy-sync ${REV} > /dev/nu
ll 2>&1
svnsync copy-revprops http://slave2.example.com/svn-proxy-sync ${REV} > /dev/nu
ll 2>&1
svnsync copy-revprops http://slave3.example.com/svn-proxy-sync ${REV} > /dev/nu
ll 2>&1

   The only thing we've left out here is what to do about locks. Because
   locks are strictly enforced by the master server (the only place where
   commits happen), we don't technically need to do anything. Many teams
   don't use Subversion's locking features at all, so it may be a nonissue
   for you. However, if lock changes aren't replicated from master to
   slaves, it means that clients won't be able to query the status of
   locks (e.g., svn status -u will show no information about repository
   locks). If this bothers you, you can write post-lock and post-unlock
   hook scripts that run svn lock and svn unlock on each slave machine,
   presumably through a remote shell method such as SSH. That's left as an
   exercise for the reader!

Caveats

   Your master/slave replication system should now be ready to use. A
   couple of words of warning are in order, however. Remember that this
   replication isn't entirely robust in the face of computer or network
   crashes. For example, if one of the automated svnsync commands fails to
   complete for some reason, the slaves will begin to fall behind. For
   example, your remote users will see that they've committed revision
   100, but then when they run svn update, their local server will tell
   them that revision 100 doesn't yet exist! Of course, the problem will
   be automatically fixed the next time another commit happens and the
   subsequent svnsync is successfulâthe sync will replicate all waiting
   revisions. But still, you may want to set up some sort of out-of-band
   monitoring to notice synchronization failures and force svnsync to run
   when things go wrong.

   Can We Set Up Replication with svnserve?

   If you're using svnserve instead of Apache as your server, you can
   certainly configure your repository's hook scripts to invoke svnsync as
   we've shown here, thereby causing automatic replication from master to
   slaves. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing there is no way to
   make slave svnserve servers automatically proxy write requests back to
   the master server. This means your users would only be able to check
   out read-only working copies from the slave servers. You'd have to
   configure your slave servers to disallow write access completely. This
   might be useful for creating read-only âmirrorsâ of popular open source
   projects, but it's not a transparent proxying system.

Other Apache features

   Several of the features already provided by Apache in its role as a
   robust web server can be leveraged for increased functionality or
   security in Subversion as well. The Subversion client is able to use
   SSL (the Secure Sockets Layer, discussed earlier). If your Subversion
   client is built to support SSL, it can access your Apache server using
   https:// and enjoy a high-quality encrypted network session.

   Equally useful are other features of the Apache and Subversion
   relationship, such as the ability to specify a custom port (instead of
   the default HTTP port 80) or a virtual domain name by which the
   Subversion repository should be accessed, or the ability to access the
   repository through an HTTP proxy.

   Finally, because mod_dav_svn is speaking a subset of the WebDAV/DeltaV
   protocol, it's possible to access the repository via third-party DAV
   clients. Most modern operating systems (Win32, OS X, and Linux) have
   the built-in ability to mount a DAV server as a standard network
   âshared folder.â This is a complicated topic, but also wondrous when
   implemented. For details, read Appendix C, WebDAV and Autoversioning.

   Note that there are a number of other small tweaks one can make to
   mod_dav_svn that are too obscure to mention in this chapter. For a
   complete list of all httpd.conf directives that mod_dav_svn responds
   to, see the section called âDirectivesâ.

Path-Based Authorization

   Both Apache and svnserve are capable of granting (or denying)
   permissions to users. Typically this is done over the entire
   repository: a user can read the repository (or not), and she can write
   to the repository (or not). It's also possible, however, to define
   finer-grained access rules. One set of users may have permission to
   write to a certain directory in the repository, but not others; another
   directory might not even be readable by all but a few special people.

   Both servers use a common file format to describe these path-based
   access rules. In the case of Apache, one needs to load the
   mod_authz_svn module and then add the AuthzSVNAccessFile directive
   (within the httpd.conf file) pointing to your own rules file. (For a
   full explanation, see the section called âPer-directory access
   controlâ.) If you're using svnserve, you need to make the authz-db
   variable (within svnserve.conf) point to your rules file.

   Do You Really Need Path-Based Access Control?

   A lot of administrators setting up Subversion for the first time tend
   to jump into path-based access control without giving it a lot of
   thought. The administrator usually knows which teams of people are
   working on which projects, so it's easy to jump in and grant certain
   teams access to certain directories and not others. It seems like a
   natural thing, and it appeases the administrator's desire to maintain
   tight control of the repository.

   Note, though, that there are often invisible (and visible!) costs
   associated with this feature. In the visible category, the server needs
   to do a lot more work to ensure that the user has the right to read or
   write each specific path; in certain situations, there's very
   noticeable performance loss. In the invisible category, consider the
   culture you're creating. Most of the time, while certain users
   shouldn't be committing changes to certain parts of the repository,
   that social contract doesn't need to be technologically enforced. Teams
   can sometimes spontaneously collaborate with each other; someone may
   want to help someone else out by committing to an area she doesn't
   normally work on. By preventing this sort of thing at the server level,
   you're setting up barriers to unexpected collaboration. You're also
   creating a bunch of rules that need to be maintained as projects
   develop, new users are added, and so on. It's a bunch of extra work to
   maintain.

   Remember that this is a version control system! Even if somebody
   accidentally commits a change to something she shouldn't, it's easy to
   undo the change. And if a user commits to the wrong place with
   deliberate malice, it's a social problem anyway, and that the problem
   needs to be dealt with outside Subversion.

   So, before you begin restricting users' access rights, ask yourself
   whether there's a real, honest need for this, or whether it's just
   something that âsounds goodâ to an administrator. Decide whether it's
   worth sacrificing some server speed, and remember that there's very
   little risk involved; it's bad to become dependent on technology as a
   crutch for social problems. ^[48]

   As an example to ponder, consider that the Subversion project itself
   has always had a notion of who is allowed to commit where, but it's
   always been enforced socially. This is a good model of community trust,
   especially for open source projects. Of course, sometimes there are
   truly legitimate needs for path-based access control; within
   corporations, for example, certain types of data really can be
   sensitive, and access needs to be genuinely restricted to small groups
   of people.

   Once your server knows where to find your rules file, it's time to
   define the rules.

   The syntax of the file is the same familiar one used by svnserve.conf
   and the runtime configuration files. Lines that start with a hash (#)
   are ignored. In its simplest form, each section names a repository and
   path within it, as well as the authenticated usernames are the option
   names within each section. The value of each option describes the
   user's level of access to the repository path: either r (read-only) or
   rw (read/write). If the user is not mentioned at all, no access is
   allowed.

   To be more specific: the value of the section names is either of the
   form [repos-name:path] or of the form [path]. If you're using the
   SVNParentPath directive, it's important to specify the repository names
   in your sections. If you omit them, a section such as [/some/dir] will
   match the path /some/dir in every repository. If you're using the
   SVNPath directive, however, it's fine to only define paths in your
   sectionsâafter all, there's only one repository.
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r

   In this first example, the user harry has full read and write access on
   the /branches/calc/bug-142 directory in the calc repository, but the
   user sally has read-only access. Any other users are blocked from
   accessing this directory.

   Of course, permissions are inherited from parent to child directory.
   That means we can specify a subdirectory with a different access policy
   for Sally:
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r

# give sally write access only to the 'testing' subdir
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142/testing]
sally = rw

   Now Sally can write to the testing subdirectory of the branch, but can
   still only read other parts. Harry, meanwhile, continues to have
   complete read/write access to the whole branch.

   It's also possible to explicitly deny permission to someone via
   inheritance rules, by setting the username variable to nothing:
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r

[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142/secret]
harry =

   In this example, Harry has read/write access to the entire bug-142
   tree, but has absolutely no access at all to the secret subdirectory
   within it.

Tip

   The thing to remember is that the most specific path always matches
   first. The server tries to match the path itself, and then the parent
   of the path, then the parent of that, and so on. The net effect is that
   mentioning a specific path in the access file will always override any
   permissions inherited from parent directories.

   By default, nobody has any access to the repository at all. That means
   that if you're starting with an empty file, you'll probably want to
   give at least read permission to all users at the root of the
   repository. You can do this by using the asterisk variable (*), which
   means âall usersâ:
[/]
* = r

   This is a common setup; notice that no repository name is mentioned in
   the section name. This makes all repositories world-readable to all
   users. Once all users have read access to the repositories, you can
   give explicit rw permission to certain users on specific subdirectories
   within specific repositories.

   The asterisk variable (*) is also worth special mention because it's
   the only pattern that matches an anonymous user. If you've configured
   your server block to allow a mixture of anonymous and authenticated
   access, all users start out accessing anonymously. The server looks for
   a * value defined for the path being accessed; if it can't find one, it
   demands real authentication from the client.

   The access file also allows you to define whole groups of users, much
   like the Unix /etc/group file:
[groups]
calc-developers = harry, sally, joe
paint-developers = frank, sally, jane
everyone = harry, sally, joe, frank, sally, jane

   Groups can be granted access control just like users. Distinguish them
   with an âatâ (@) prefix:
[calc:/projects/calc]
@calc-developers = rw

[paint:/projects/paint]
jane = r
@paint-developers = rw

   Another important fact is that the first matching rule is the one which
   gets applied to a user. In the prior example, even though Jane is a
   member of the paint-developers group (which has read/write access), the
   jane = r rule will be discovered and matched before the group rule,
   thus denying Jane write access.

   Groups can also be defined to contain other groups:
[groups]
calc-developers = harry, sally, joe
paint-developers = frank, sally, jane
everyone = @calc-developers, @paint-developers

   Subversion 1.5 brings another useful feature to the access file syntax:
   username aliases. Some authentication systems expect and carry
   relatively short usernames of the sorts we've been describing
   hereâharry, sally, joe, and so on. But other authentication
   systemsâsuch as those which use LDAP stores or SSL client
   certificatesâmay carry much more complex usernames. For example,
   Harry's username in an LDAP-protected system might be CN=Harold
   Hacker,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com. With usernames like that, the
   access file can become quite bloated with long or obscure usernames
   that are easy to mistype. Fortunately, username aliases allow you to
   have to type the correct complex username only once, in a statement
   which assigns to it a more easily digestable alias.
[aliases]
harry = CN=Harold Hacker,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
sally = CN=Sally Swatterbug,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
joe = CN=Gerald I. Joseph,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
â¦

   Once you've defined a set of aliases, you can refer to the users
   elsewhere in the access file via their aliases in all the same places
   you could have instead used their actual usernames. Simply prepend an
   ampersand to the alias to distinguish it from a regular username:
[groups]
calc-developers = &harry, &sally, &joe
paint-developers = &frank, &sally, &jane
everyone = @calc-developers, @paint-developers

   You might also choose to use aliases if your users' usernames change
   frequently. Doing so allows you to need to update only the aliases
   table when these username changes occur, instead of doing
   global-search-and-replace operations on the whole access file.

   Partial Readability and Checkouts

   If you're using Apache as your Subversion server and have made certain
   subdirectories of your repository unreadable to certain users, you need
   to be aware of a possible nonoptimal behavior with svn checkout.

   When the client requests a checkout or update over HTTP, it makes a
   single server request and receives a single (often large) server
   response. When the server receives the request, that is the only
   opportunity Apache has to demand user authentication. This has some odd
   side effects. For example, if a certain subdirectory of the repository
   is readable only by user Sally, and user Harry checks out a parent
   directory, his client will respond to the initial authentication
   challenge as Harry. As the server generates the large response, there's
   no way it can resend an authentication challenge when it reaches the
   special subdirectory; thus the subdirectory is skipped altogether,
   rather than asking the user to reauthenticate as Sally at the right
   moment. In a similar way, if the root of the repository is anonymously
   world-readable, the entire checkout will be done without
   authenticationâagain, skipping the unreadable directory, rather than
   asking for authentication partway through.

Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods

   You've seen how a repository can be accessed in many different ways.
   But is it possibleâor safeâfor your repository to be accessed by
   multiple methods simultaneously? The answer is yes, provided you use a
   bit of foresight.

   At any given time, these processes may require read and write access to
   your repository:
     * Regular system users using a Subversion client (as themselves) to
       access the repository directly via file:// URLs
     * Regular system users connecting to SSH-spawned private svnserve
       processes (running as themselves), which access the repository
     * An svnserve processâeither a daemon or one launched by
       inetdârunning as a particular fixed user
     * An Apache httpd process, running as a particular fixed user

   The most common problem administrators run into is repository ownership
   and permissions. Does every process (or user) in the preceding list
   have the rights to read and write the repository's underlying data
   files? Assuming you have a Unix-like operating system, a
   straightforward approach might be to place every potential repository
   user into a new svn group, and make the repository wholly owned by that
   group. But even that's not enough, because a process may write to the
   database files using an unfriendly umaskâone that prevents access by
   other users.

   So the next step beyond setting up a common group for repository users
   is to force every repository-accessing process to use a sane umask. For
   users accessing the repository directly, you can make the svn program
   into a wrapper script that first runs umask 002 and then runs the real
   svn client program. You can write a similar wrapper script for the
   svnserve program, and add a umask 002 command to Apache's own startup
   script, apachectl. For example:
$ cat /usr/bin/svn

#!/bin/sh

umask 002
/usr/bin/svn-real "$@"


   Another common problem is often encountered on Unix-like systems. If
   your repository is backed by Berkeley DB, for example, it occasionally
   creates new log files to journal its actions. Even if the Berkeley DB
   repository is wholly owned by the svn group, these newly created log
   files won't necessarily be owned by that same group, which then creates
   more permissions problems for your users. A good workaround is to set
   the group SUID bit on the repository's db directory. This causes all
   newly created log files to have the same group owner as the parent
   directory.

   Once you've jumped through these hoops, your repository should be
   accessible by all the necessary processes. It may seem a bit messy and
   complicated, but the problems of having multiple users sharing write
   access to common files are classic ones that are not often elegantly
   solved.

   Fortunately, most repository administrators will never need to have
   such a complex configuration. Users who wish to access repositories
   that live on the same machine are not limited to using file:// access
   URLsâthey can typically contact the Apache HTTP server or svnserve
   using localhost for the server name in their http:// or svn:// URL. And
   maintaining multiple server processes for your Subversion repositories
   is likely to be more of a headache than necessary. We recommend that
   you choose a single server that best meets your needs and stick with
   it!

   The svn+ssh:// Server Checklist

   It can be quite tricky to get a bunch of users with existing SSH
   accounts to share a repository without permissions problems. If you're
   confused about all the things that you (as an administrator) need to do
   on a Unix-like system, here's a quick checklist that resummarizes some
   of the topics discussed in this section:
     * All of your SSH users need to be able to read and write to the
       repository, so put all the SSH users into a single group.
     * Make the repository wholly owned by that group.
     * Set the group permissions to read/write.
     * Your users need to use a sane umask when accessing the repository,
       so make sure svnserve (/usr/bin/svnserve, or wherever it lives in
       $PATH) is actually a wrapper script that runs umask 002 and
       executes the real svnserve binary.
     * Take similar measures when using svnlook and svnadmin. Either run
       them with a sane umask or wrap them as just described.

   Summary

   Version control can be a complex subject, as much art as science, that
   offers myriad ways of getting stuff done. Throughout this book, you've
   read of the various Subversion command-line client subcommands and the
   options that modify their behavior. In this chapter, we'll look into
   still more ways to customize the way Subversion works for youâsetting
   up the Subversion runtime configuration, using external helper
   applications, Subversion's interaction with the operating system's
   configured locale, and so on.

Runtime Configuration Area

   Subversion provides many optional behaviors that the user can control.
   Many of these options are of the kind that a user would wish to apply
   to all Subversion operations. So, rather than forcing users to remember
   command-line arguments for specifying these options and to use them for
   every operation they perform, Subversion uses configuration files,
   segregated into a Subversion configuration area.

   The Subversion configuration area is a two-tiered hierarchy of option
   names and their values. Usually, this boils down to a special directory
   that contains configuration files (the first tier), which are just text
   files in standard INI format (with âsectionsâ providing the second
   tier). You can easily edit these files using your favorite text editor
   (such as Emacs or vi), and they contain directives read by the client
   to determine which of several optional behaviors the user prefers.

Configuration Area Layout

   The first time the svn command-line client is executed, it creates a
   per-user configuration area. On Unix-like systems, this area appears as
   a directory named .subversion in the user's home directory. On Win32
   systems, Subversion creates a folder named Subversion, typically inside
   the Application Data area of the user's profile directory (which, by
   the way, is usually a hidden directory). However, on this platform, the
   exact location differs from system to system and is dictated by the
   Windows Registry. ^[49] We will refer to the per-user configuration
   area using its Unix name, .subversion.

   In addition to the per-user configuration area, Subversion also
   recognizes the existence of a system-wide configuration area. This
   gives system administrators the ability to establish defaults for all
   users on a given machine. Note that the system-wide configuration area
   alone does not dictate mandatory policyâthe settings in the per-user
   configuration area override those in the system-wide one, and
   command-line arguments supplied to the svn program have the final word
   on behavior. On Unix-like platforms, the system-wide configuration area
   is expected to be the /etc/subversion directory; on Windows machines,
   it looks for a Subversion directory inside the common Application Data
   location (again, as specified by the Windows Registry). Unlike the
   per-user case, the svn program does not attempt to create the
   system-wide configuration area.

   The per-user configuration area currently contains three filesâtwo
   configuration files (config and servers), and a README.txt file, which
   describes the INI format. At the time of their creation, the files
   contain default values for each of the supported Subversion options,
   mostly commented out and grouped with textual descriptions about how
   the values for the key affect Subversion's behavior. To change a
   certain behavior, you need only to load the appropriate configuration
   file into a text editor, and to modify the desired option's value. If
   at any time you wish to have the default configuration settings
   restored, you can simply remove (or rename) your configuration
   directory and then run some innocuous svn command, such as svn
   --version. A new configuration directory with the default contents will
   be created.

   The per-user configuration area also contains a cache of authentication
   data. The auth directory holds a set of subdirectories that contain
   pieces of cached information used by Subversion's various supported
   authentication methods. This directory is created in such a way that
   only the user herself has permission to read its contents.

Configuration and the Windows Registry

   In addition to the usual INI-based configuration area, Subversion
   clients running on Windows platforms may also use the Windows Registry
   to hold the configuration data. The option names and their values are
   the same as in the INI files. The âfile/sectionâ hierarchy is preserved
   as well, though addressed in a slightly different fashionâin this
   schema, files and sections are just levels in the Registry key tree.

   Subversion looks for system-wide configuration values under the
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion key. For example, the
   global-ignores option, which is in the miscellany section of the config
   file, would be found at
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config\Miscellany\glo
   bal-ignores. Per-user configuration values should be stored under
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion.

   Registry-based configuration options are parsed before their file-based
   counterparts, so they are overridden by values found in the
   configuration files. In other words, Subversion looks for configuration
   information in the following locations on a Windows system;
   lower-numbered locations take precedence over higher-numbered
   locations:
    1. Command-line options
    2. The per-user INI files
    3. The per-user Registry values
    4. The system-wide INI files
    5. The system-wide Registry values

   Also, the Windows Registry doesn't really support the notion of
   something being âcommented out.â However, Subversion will ignore any
   option key whose name begins with a hash (#) character. This allows you
   to effectively comment out a Subversion option without deleting the
   entire key from the Registry, obviously simplifying the process of
   restoring that option.

   The svn command-line client never attempts to write to the Windows
   Registry and will not attempt to create a default configuration area
   there. You can create the keys you need using the REGEDIT program.
   Alternatively, you can create a .reg file (such as the one in
   Example 7.1, âSample registration entries (.reg) fileâ), and then
   double-click on that file's icon in the Explorer shell, which will
   cause the data to be merged into your Registry.

   The previous example shows the contents of a .reg file, which contains
   some of the most commonly used configuration options and their default
   values. Note the presence of both system-wide (for network
   proxy-related options) and per-user settings (editor programs and
   password storage, among others). Also note that all the options are
   effectively commented out. You need only to remove the hash (#)
   character from the beginning of the option names and set the values as
   you desire.

Configuration Options

   In this section, we will discuss the specific runtime configuration
   options that Subversion currently supports.

Servers

   The servers file contains Subversion configuration options related to
   the network layers. There are two special section names in this
   fileâgroups and global. The groups section is essentially a
   cross-reference table. The keys in this section are the names of other
   sections in the file; their values are globsâtextual tokens that
   possibly contain wildcard charactersâthat are compared against the
   hostnames of the machine to which Subversion requests are sent.
[groups]
beanie-babies = *.red-bean.com
collabnet = svn.collab.net

   When Subversion is used over a network, it attempts to match the name
   of the server it is trying to reach with a group name under the groups
   section. If a match is made, Subversion then looks for a section in the
   servers file whose name is the matched group's name. From that section,
   it reads the actual network configuration settings.

   The global section contains the settings that are meant for all of the
   servers not matched by one of the globs under the groups section. The
   options available in this section are exactly the same as those that
   are valid for the other server sections in the file (except, of course,
   the special groups section), and are as follows:

   http-proxy-exceptions
          This specifies a comma-separated list of patterns for repository
          hostnames that should be accessed directly, without using the
          proxy machine. The pattern syntax is the same as is used in the
          Unix shell for filenames. A repository hostname matching any of
          these patterns will not be proxied.

   http-proxy-host
          This specifies the hostname of the proxy computer through which
          your HTTP-based Subversion requests must pass. It defaults to an
          empty value, which means that Subversion will not attempt to
          route HTTP requests through a proxy computer, and will instead
          attempt to contact the destination machine directly.

   http-proxy-port
          This specifies the port number on the proxy host to use. It
          defaults to an empty value.

   http-proxy-username
          This specifies the username to supply to the proxy machine. It
          defaults to an empty value.

   http-proxy-password
          This specifies the password to supply to the proxy machine. It
          defaults to an empty value.

   http-timeout
          This specifies the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a
          server response. If you experience problems with a slow network
          connection causing Subversion operations to time out, you should
          increase the value of this option. The default value is 0, which
          instructs the underlying HTTP library, Neon, to use its default
          timeout setting.

   http-compression
          This specifies whether Subversion should attempt to compress
          network requests made to DAV-ready servers. The default value is
          yes (though compression will occur only if that capability is
          compiled into the network layer). Set this to no to disable
          compression, such as when debugging network transmissions.

   http-library
          Subversion provides a pair of repository access modules that
          understand its WebDAV network protocol. The original one, which
          shipped with Subversion 1.0, is libsvn_ra_neon (though back then
          it was called libsvn_ra_dav). Newer Subversion versions also
          provide libsvn_ra_serf, which uses a different underlying
          implementation and aims to support some of the newer HTTP
          concepts.

          At this point, libsvn_ra_serf is still considered experimental,
          though it appears to work in the common cases quite well. To
          encourage experimentation, Subversion provides the http-library
          runtime configuration option to allow users to specify
          (generally, or in a per-server-group fashion) which WebDAV
          access module they'd prefer to useâneon or serf.

   http-auth-types
          This option is a semicolon-delimited list of authentication
          types supported by the Neon-based WebDAV repository access
          modules. Valid members of this list are basic, digest, and
          negotiate.

   neon-debug-mask
          This is an integer mask that the underlying HTTP library, Neon,
          uses for choosing what type of debugging output to yield. The
          default value is 0, which will silence all debugging output. For
          more information about how Subversion makes use of Neon, see
          Chapter 8, Embedding Subversion.

   ssl-authority-files
          This is a semicolon-delimited list of paths to files containing
          certificates of the certificate authorities (or CAs) that are
          accepted by the Subversion client when accessing the repository
          over HTTPS.

   ssl-trust-default-ca
          Set this variable to yes if you want Subversion to automatically
          trust the set of default CAs that ship with OpenSSL.

   ssl-client-cert-file
          If a host (or set of hosts) requires an SSL client certificate,
          you'll normally be prompted for a path to your certificate. By
          setting this variable to that same path, Subversion will be able
          to find your client certificate automatically without prompting
          you. There's no standard place to store your certificate on
          disk; Subversion will grab it from any path you specify.

   ssl-client-cert-password
          If your SSL client certificate file is encrypted by a
          passphrase, Subversion will prompt you for the passphrase
          whenever the certificate is used. If you find this annoying (and
          don't mind storing the password in the servers file), you can
          set this variable to the certificate's passphrase. You won't be
          prompted anymore.

Config

   The config file contains the rest of the currently available Subversion
   runtime optionsâthose not related to networking. There are only a few
   options in use as of this writing, but they are again grouped into
   sections in expectation of future additions.

   The auth section contains settings related to Subversion's
   authentication and authorization against the repository. It contains
   the following:

   store-passwords
          This instructs Subversion to cache, or not to cache, passwords
          that are supplied by the user in response to server
          authentication challenges. The default value is yes. Set this to
          no to disable this on-disk password caching. You can override
          this option for a single instance of the svn command using the
          --no-auth-cache command-line parameter (for those subcommands
          that support it). For more information, see the section called
          âClient Credentials Cachingâ.

   store-auth-creds
          This setting is the same as store-passwords, except that it
          enables or disables on-disk caching of all authentication
          information: usernames, passwords, server certificates, and any
          other types of cacheable credentials.

   The helpers section controls which external applications Subversion
   uses to accomplish its tasks. Valid options in this section are:

   editor-cmd
          This specifies the program Subversion will use to query the user
          for certain types of textual metadata or when interactively
          resolving conflicts. See the section called âUsing External
          Editorsâ for more details on using external text editors with
          Subversion.

   diff-cmd
          This specifies the absolute path of a differencing program, used
          when Subversion generates âdiffâ output (such as when using the
          svn diff command). By default, Subversion uses an internal
          differencing libraryâsetting this option will cause it to
          perform this task using an external program. See the section
          called âUsing External Differencing and Merge Toolsâ for more
          details on using such programs.

   diff3-cmd
          This specifies the absolute path of a three-way differencing
          program. Subversion uses this program to merge changes made by
          the user with those received from the repository. By default,
          Subversion uses an internal differencing libraryâsetting this
          option will cause it to perform this task using an external
          program. See the section called âUsing External Differencing and
          Merge Toolsâ for more details on using such programs.

   diff3-has-program-arg
          This flag should be set to true if the program specified by the
          diff3-cmd option accepts a --diff-program command-line
          parameter.

   merge-tool-cmd
          This specifies the program that Subversion will use to perform
          three-way merge operations on your versioned files. See the
          section called âUsing External Differencing and Merge Toolsâ for
          more details on using such programs.

   The tunnels section allows you to define new tunnel schemes for use
   with svnserve and svn:// client connections. For more details, see the
   section called âTunneling over SSHâ.

   The miscellany section is where everything that doesn't belong
   elsewhere winds up. ^[50] In this section, you can find:

   global-ignores
          When running the svn status command, Subversion lists
          unversioned files and directories along with the versioned ones,
          annotating them with a ? character (see the section called âSee
          an overview of your changesâ). Sometimes it can be annoying to
          see uninteresting, unversioned itemsâfor example, object files
          that result from a program's compilationâin this display. The
          global-ignores option is a list of whitespace-delimited globs
          that describe the names of files and directories that Subversion
          should not display unless they are versioned. The default value
          is *.o *.lo *.la #*# .*.rej *.rej .*~ *~ .#* .DS_Store.

          As well as svn status, the svn add and svn import commands also
          ignore files that match the list when they are scanning a
          directory. You can override this behavior for a single instance
          of any of these commands by explicitly specifying the filename,
          or by using the --no-ignore command-line flag.

          For information on finer-grained control of ignored items, see
          the section called âIgnoring Unversioned Itemsâ.

   enable-auto-props
          This instructs Subversion to automatically set properties on
          newly added or imported files. The default value is no, so set
          this to yes to enable this feature. The auto-props section of
          this file specifies which properties are to be set on which
          files.

   log-encoding
          This variable sets the default character set encoding for commit
          log messages. It's a permanent form of the --encoding option
          (see the section called âsvn Optionsâ). The Subversion
          repository stores log messages in UTF-8 and assumes that your
          log message is written using your operating system's native
          locale. You should specify a different encoding if your commit
          messages are written in any other encoding.

   use-commit-times
          Normally your working copy files have timestamps that reflect
          the last time they were touched by any process, whether your own
          editor or some svn subcommand. This is generally convenient for
          people developing software, because build systems often look at
          timestamps as a way of deciding which files need to be
          recompiled.

          In other situations, however, it's sometimes nice for the
          working copy files to have timestamps that reflect the last time
          they were changed in the repository. The svn export command
          always places these âlast-commit timestampsâ on trees that it
          produces. By setting this config variable to yes, the svn
          checkout, svn update, svn switch, and svn revert commands will
          also set last-commit timestamps on files that they touch.

   mime-types-file
          This option, new to Subversion 1.5, specifies the path of a MIME
          types mapping file, such as the mime.types file provided by the
          Apache HTTP Server. Subversion uses this file to assign MIME
          types to newly added or imported files. See the section called
          âAutomatic Property Settingâ and the section called âFile
          Content Typeâ for more about Subversion's detection and use of
          file content types.

   preserved-conflict-file-exts
          The value of this option is a space-delimited list of file
          extensions that Subversion should preserve when generating
          conflict filenames. By default, the list is empty. This option
          is new to Subversion 1.5.

          When Subversion detects conflicting file content changes, it
          defers resolution of those conflicts to the user. To assist in
          the resolution, Subversion keeps pristine copies of the various
          competing versions of the file in the working copy. By default,
          those conflict files have names constructed by appending to the
          original filename a custom extension such as .mine or .REV
          (where REV is a revision number). A mild annoyance with this
          naming scheme is that on operating systems where a file's
          extension determines the default application used to open and
          edit that file, appending a custom extension prevents the file
          from being easily opened by its native application. For example,
          if the file ReleaseNotes.pdf was conflicted, the conflict files
          might be named ReleaseNotes.pdf.mine or ReleaseNotes.pdf.r4231.
          While your system might be configured to use Adobe's Acrobat
          Reader to open files whose extensions are .pdf, there probably
          isn't an application configured on your system to open all files
          whose extensions are .r4231.

          You can fix this annoyance by using this configuration option,
          though. For files with one of the specified extensions,
          Subversion will append to the conflict file names the custom
          extension just as before, but then also reappend the file's
          original extension. Using the previous example, and assuming
          that pdf is one of the extensions configured in this list
          thereof, the conflict files generated for ReleaseNotes.pdf would
          instead be named ReleaseNotes.pdf.mine.pdf and
          ReleaseNotes.pdf.r4231.pdf. Because each file ends in .pdf, the
          correct default application will be used to view them.

   interactive-conflicts
          This is a Boolean option that specifies whether Subversion
          should try to resolve conflicts interactively. If its value is
          yes (which is the default value), Subversion will prompt the
          user for how to handle conflicts in the manner demonstrated in
          the section called âResolve Conflicts (Merging Others'
          Changes)â. Otherwise, it will simply flag the conflict and
          continue its operation, postponing resolution to a later time.

   no-unlock
          This Boolean option corresponds to svn commit's --no-unlock
          option, which tells Subversion not to release locks on files
          you've just committed. If this runtime option is set to yes,
          Subversion will never release locks automatically, leaving you
          to run svn unlock explicitly. It defaults to no.

   The auto-props section controls the Subversion client's ability to
   automatically set properties on files when they are added or imported.
   It contains any number of key-value pairs in the format PATTERN =
   PROPNAME=VALUE[;PROPNAME=VALUE ...], where PATTERN is a file pattern
   that matches one or more filenames and the rest of the line is a
   semicolon-delimited set of property assignments. Multiple matches on a
   file will result in multiple propsets for that file; however, there is
   no guarantee that auto-props will be applied in the order in which they
   are listed in the config file, so you can't have one rule âoverrideâ
   another. You can find several examples of auto-props usage in the
   config file. Lastly, don't forget to set enable-auto-props to yes in
   the miscellany section if you want to enable auto-props.

Localization

   Localization is the act of making programs behave in a region-specific
   way. When a program formats numbers or dates in a way specific to your
   part of the world or prints messages (or accepts input) in your native
   language, the program is said to be localized. This section describes
   steps Subversion has made toward localization.

Understanding Locales

   Most modern operating systems have a notion of the âcurrent
   localeââthat is, the region or country whose localization conventions
   are honored. These conventionsâtypically chosen by some runtime
   configuration mechanism on the computerâaffect the way in which
   programs present data to the user, as well as the way in which they
   accept user input.

   On most Unix-like systems, you can check the values of the
   locale-related runtime configuration options by running the locale
   command:
$ locale
LANG=
LC_COLLATE="C"
LC_CTYPE="C"
LC_MESSAGES="C"
LC_MONETARY="C"
LC_NUMERIC="C"
LC_TIME="C"
LC_ALL="C"
$

   The output is a list of locale-related environment variables and their
   current values. In this example, the variables are all set to the
   default C locale, but users can set these variables to specific
   country/language code combinations. For example, if one were to set the
   LC_TIME variable to fr_CA, programs would know to present time and date
   information formatted according to a French-speaking Canadian's
   expectations. And if one were to set the LC_MESSAGES variable to zh_TW,
   programs would know to present human-readable messages in Traditional
   Chinese. Setting the LC_ALL variable has the effect of changing every
   locale variable to the same value. The value of LANG is used as a
   default value for any locale variable that is unset. To see the list of
   available locales on a Unix system, run the command locale -a.

   On Windows, locale configuration is done via the âRegional and Language
   Optionsâ control panel item. There you can view and select the values
   of individual settings from the available locales, and even customize
   (at a sickening level of detail) several of the display formatting
   conventions.

Subversion's Use of Locales

   The Subversion client, svn, honors the current locale configuration in
   two ways. First, it notices the value of the LC_MESSAGES variable and
   attempts to print all messages in the specified language. For example:
$ export LC_MESSAGES=de_DE
$ svn help cat
cat: Gibt den Inhalt der angegebenen Dateien oder URLs aus.
Aufruf: cat ZIEL[@REV]...
â¦

   This behavior works identically on both Unix and Windows systems. Note,
   though, that while your operating system might have support for a
   certain locale, the Subversion client still may not be able to speak
   the particular language. In order to produce localized messages, human
   volunteers must provide translations for each language. The
   translations are written using the GNU gettext package, which results
   in translation modules that end with the .mo filename extension. For
   example, the German translation file is named de.mo. These translation
   files are installed somewhere on your system. On Unix, they typically
   live in /usr/share/locale/, while on Windows they're often found in the
   \share\locale\ folder in Subversion's installation area. Once
   installed, a module is named after the program for which it provides
   translations. For example, the de.mo file may ultimately end up
   installed as /usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/subversion.mo. By
   browsing the installed .mo files, you can see which languages the
   Subversion client is able to speak.

   The second way in which the locale is honored involves how svn
   interprets your input. The repository stores all paths, filenames, and
   log messages in Unicode, encoded as UTF-8. In that sense, the
   repository is internationalizedâthat is, the repository is ready to
   accept input in any human language. This means, however, that the
   Subversion client is responsible for sending only UTF-8 filenames and
   log messages into the repository. To do this, it must convert the data
   from the native locale into UTF-8.

   For example, suppose you create a file named caffÃ¨.txt, and then when
   committing the file, you write the log message as âAdesso il caffÃ¨ Ã¨
   piÃ¹ forte.â Both the filename and the log message contain non-ASCII
   characters, but because your locale is set to it_IT, the Subversion
   client knows to interpret them as Italian. It uses an Italian character
   set to convert the data to UTF-8 before sending it off to the
   repository.

   Note that while the repository demands UTF-8 filenames and log
   messages, it does not pay attention to file contents. Subversion treats
   file contents as opaque strings of bytes, and neither client nor server
   makes an attempt to understand the character set or encoding of the
   contents.

   Character Set Conversion Errors

   While using Subversion, you might get hit with an error related to
   character set conversions:
svn: Can't convert string from native encoding to 'UTF-8':
â¦
svn: Can't convert string from 'UTF-8' to native encoding:
â¦

   Errors such as this typically occur when the Subversion client has
   received a UTF-8 string from the repository, but not all of the
   characters in that string can be represented using the encoding of the
   current locale. For example, if your locale is en_US but a collaborator
   has committed a Japanese filename, you're likely to see this error when
   you receive the file during an svn update.

   The solution is either to set your locale to something that can
   represent the incoming UTF-8 data, or to change the filename or log
   message in the repository. (And don't forget to slap your
   collaborator's handâprojects should decide on common languages ahead of
   time so that all participants are using the same locale.)

Using External Editors

   The most obvious way to get data into Subversion is through the
   addition of files to version control, committing changes to those
   files, and so on. But other pieces of information besides merely
   versioned file data live in your Subversion repository. Some of these
   bits of informationâcommit log messages, lock comments, and some
   property valuesâtend to be textual in nature and are provided
   explicitly by users. Most of this information can be provided to the
   Subversion command-line client using the --message (-m) and --file (-F)
   options with the appropriate subcommands.

   Each of these options has its pros and cons. For example, when
   performing a commit, --file (-F) works well if you've already prepared
   a text file that holds your commit log message. If you didn't, though,
   you can use --message (-m) to provide a log message on the command
   line. Unfortunately, it can be tricky to compose anything more than a
   simple one-line message on the command line. Users want more
   flexibilityâmultiline, free-form log message editing on demand.

   Subversion supports this by allowing you to specify an external text
   editor that it will launch as necessary to give you a more powerful
   input mechanism for this textual metadata. There are several ways to
   tell Subversion which editor you'd like use. Subversion checks the
   following things, in the order specified, when it wants to launch such
   an editor:
    1. --editor-cmd command-line option
    2. SVN_EDITOR environment variable
    3. editor-cmd runtime configuration option
    4. VISUAL environment variable
    5. EDITOR environment variable
    6. Possibly, a fallback value built into the Subversion libraries (not
       present in the official builds)

   The value of any of these options or variables is the beginning of a
   command line to be executed by the shell. Subversion appends to that
   command line a space and the pathname of a temporary file to be edited.
   So, to be used with Subversion, the configured or specified editor
   needs to support an invocation in which its last command-line parameter
   is a file to be edited, and it should be able to save the file in place
   and return a zero exit code to indicate success.

   As noted, external editors can be used to provide commit log messages
   to any of the committing subcommands (such as svn commit or import, svn
   mkdir or delete when provided a URL target, etc.), and Subversion will
   try to launch the editor automatically if you don't specify either of
   the --message (-m) or --file (-F) options. The svn propedit command is
   built almost entirely around the use of an external editor. And
   beginning in version 1.5, Subversion will also use the configured
   external text editor when the user asks it to launch an editor during
   interactive conflict resolution. Oddly, there doesn't appear to be a
   way to use external editors to interactively provide lock comments.

Using External Differencing and Merge Tools

   The interface between Subversion and external two- and three-way
   differencing tools harkens back to a time when Subversion's only
   contextual differencing capabilities were built around invocations of
   the GNU diffutils toolchain, specifically the diff and diff3 utilities.
   To get the kind of behavior Subversion needed, it called these
   utilities with more than a handful of options and parameters, most of
   which were quite specific to the utilities. Some time later, Subversion
   grew its own internal differencing library, and as a failover
   mechanism, the --diff-cmd and --diff3-cmd options were added to the
   Subversion command-line client so that users could more easily indicate
   that they preferred to use the GNU diff and diff3 utilities instead of
   the newfangled internal diff library. If those options were used,
   Subversion would simply ignore the internal diff library, and fall back
   to running those external programs, lengthy argument lists and all. And
   that's where things remain today.

   It didn't take long for folks to realize that having such easy
   configuration mechanisms for specifying that Subversion should use the
   external GNU diff and diff3 utilities located at a particular place on
   the system could be applied toward the use of other differencing tools,
   too. After all, Subversion didn't actually verify that the things it
   was being told to run were members of the GNU diffutils toolchain. But
   the only configurable aspect of using those external tools is their
   location on the systemânot the option set, parameter order, and so on.
   Subversion continues to throw all those GNU utility options at your
   external diff tool regardless of whether that program can understand
   those options. And that's where things get unintuitive for most users.

   The key to using external two- and three-way differencing tools (other
   than GNU diff and diff3, of course) with Subversion is to use wrapper
   scripts, which convert the input from Subversion into something that
   your differencing tool can understand, and then to convert the output
   of your tool back into a format that Subversion expectsâthe format that
   the GNU tools would have used. The following sections cover the
   specifics of those expectations.

Note

   The decision on when to fire off a contextual two- or three-way diff as
   part of a larger Subversion operation is made entirely by Subversion
   and is affected by, among other things, whether the files being
   operated on are human-readable as determined by their svn:mime-type
   property. This means, for example, that even if you had the niftiest
   Microsoft Word-aware differencing or merging tool in the universe, it
   would never be invoked by Subversion as long as your versioned Word
   documents had a configured MIME type that denoted that they were not
   human-readable (such as application/msword). For more about MIME type
   settings, see the section called âFile Content Typeâ

   Subversion 1.5 introduces interactive resolution of conflicts
   (described in the section called âResolve Conflicts (Merging Others'
   Changes)â), and one of the options provided to users is the ability to
   launch a third-party merge tool. If this action is taken, Subversion
   will consult the merge-tool-cmd runtime configuration option to find
   the name of an external merge tool and, upon finding one, will launch
   that tool with the appropriate input files. This differs from the
   configurable three-way differencing tool in a couple of ways. First,
   the differencing tool is always used to handle three-way differences,
   whereas the merge tool is employed only when three-way difference
   application has detected a conflict. Second, the interface is much
   cleanerâyour configured merge tool need only accept as command-line
   parameters four path specifications: the base file, the âtheirsâ file
   (which contains upstream changes), the âmineâ file (which contains
   local modifications), and the path of the file where the final resolved
   contents should be stored.

External diff

   Subversion calls external diff programs with parameters suitable for
   the GNU diff utility, and expects only that the external program will
   return with a successful error code. For most alternative diff
   programs, only the sixth and seventh argumentsâthe paths of the files
   that represent the left and right sides of the diff, respectivelyâare
   of interest. Note that Subversion runs the diff program once per
   modified file covered by the Subversion operation, so if your program
   runs in an asynchronous fashion (or is âbackgroundedâ), you might have
   several instances of it all running simultaneously. Finally, Subversion
   expects that your program return an error code of 1 if your program
   detected differences, or 0 if it did notâany other error code is
   considered a fatal error. ^[51]

   Example 7.2, âdiffwrap.pyâ and Example 7.3, âdiffwrap.batâ are
   templates for external diff tool wrappers in the Python and Windows
   batch scripting languages, respectively.

   Example 7.2. diffwrap.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import os

# Configure your favorite diff program here.
DIFF = "/usr/local/bin/my-diff-tool"

# Subversion provides the paths we need as the last two parameters.
LEFT  = sys.argv[-2]
RIGHT = sys.argv[-1]

# Call the diff command (change the following line to make sense for
# your diff program).
cmd = [DIFF, '--left', LEFT, '--right', RIGHT]
os.execv(cmd[0], cmd)

# Return an errorcode of 0 if no differences were detected, 1 if some were.
# Any other errorcode will be treated as fatal.

   Example 7.3. diffwrap.bat
@ECHO OFF

REM Configure your favorite diff program here.
SET DIFF="C:\Program Files\Funky Stuff\My Diff Tool.exe"

REM Subversion provides the paths we need as the last two parameters.
REM These are parameters 6 and 7 (unless you use svn diff -x, in
REM which case, all bets are off).
SET LEFT=%6
SET RIGHT=%7

REM Call the diff command (change the following line to make sense for
REM your diff program).
%DIFF% --left %LEFT% --right %RIGHT%

REM Return an errorcode of 0 if no differences were detected, 1 if some were.
REM Any other errorcode will be treated as fatal.

External diff3

   Subversion calls external merge programs with parameters suitable for
   the GNU diff3 utility, expecting that the external program will return
   with a successful error code and that the full file contents that
   result from the completed merge operation are printed on the standard
   output stream (so that Subversion can redirect them into the
   appropriate version-controlled file). For most alternative merge
   programs, only the ninth, tenth, and eleventh arguments, the paths of
   the files which represent the âmine,â âolder,â and âyoursâ inputs,
   respectively, are of interest. Note that because Subversion depends on
   the output of your merge program, your wrapper script must not exit
   before that output has been delivered to Subversion. When it finally
   does exit, it should return an error code of 0 if the merge was
   successful, or 1 if unresolved conflicts remain in the outputâany other
   error code is considered a fatal error.

   Example 7.4, âdiff3wrap.pyâ and Example 7.5, âdiff3wrap.batâ are
   templates for external merge tool wrappers in the Python and Windows
   batch scripting languages, respectively.

   Example 7.4. diff3wrap.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import os

# Configure your favorite diff program here.
DIFF3 = "/usr/local/bin/my-merge-tool"

# Subversion provides the paths we need as the last three parameters.
MINE  = sys.argv[-3]
OLDER = sys.argv[-2]
YOURS = sys.argv[-1]

# Call the merge command (change the following line to make sense for
# your merge program).
cmd = [DIFF3, '--older', OLDER, '--mine', MINE, '--yours', YOURS]
os.execv(cmd[0], cmd)

# After performing the merge, this script needs to print the contents
# of the merged file to stdout.  Do that in whatever way you see fit.
# Return an errorcode of 0 on successful merge, 1 if unresolved conflicts
# remain in the result.  Any other errorcode will be treated as fatal.

   Example 7.5. diff3wrap.bat
@ECHO OFF

REM Configure your favorite diff3/merge program here.
SET DIFF3="C:\Program Files\Funky Stuff\My Merge Tool.exe"

REM Subversion provides the paths we need as the last three parameters.
REM These are parameters 9, 10, and 11.  But we have access to only
REM nine parameters at a time, so we shift our nine-parameter window
REM twice to let us get to what we need.
SHIFT
SHIFT
SET MINE=%7
SET OLDER=%8
SET YOURS=%9

REM Call the merge command (change the following line to make sense for
REM your merge program).
%DIFF3% --older %OLDER% --mine %MINE% --yours %YOURS%

REM After performing the merge, this script needs to print the contents
REM of the merged file to stdout.  Do that in whatever way you see fit.
REM Return an errorcode of 0 on successful merge, 1 if unresolved conflicts
REM remain in the result.  Any other errorcode will be treated as fatal.

Summary

   Sometimes there's a single right way to do things; sometimes there are
   many. Subversion's developers understand that while the majority of its
   exact behaviors are acceptable to most of its users, there are some
   corners of its functionality where such a universally pleasing approach
   doesn't exist. In those places, Subversion offers users the opportunity
   to tell it how they want it to behave.

   In this chapter, we explored Subversion's runtime configuration system
   and other mechanisms by which users can control those configurable
   behaviors. If you are a developer, though, the next chapter will take
   you one step further. It describes how you can further customize your
   Subversion experience by writing your own software against Subversion's
   libraries.

   Summary

   Subversion has a modular design: it's implemented as a collection of
   libraries written in C. Each library has a well-defined purpose and
   application programming interface (API), and that interface is
   available not only for Subversion itself to use, but for any software
   that wishes to embed or otherwise programmatically control Subversion.
   Additionally, Subversion's API is available not only to other C
   programs, but also to programs written in higher-level languages such
   as Python, Perl, Java, and Ruby.

   This chapter is for those who wish to interact with Subversion through
   its public API or its various language bindings. If you wish to write
   robust wrapper scripts around Subversion functionality to simplify your
   own life, are trying to develop more complex integrations between
   Subversion and other pieces of software, or just have an interest in
   Subversion's various library modules and what they offer, this chapter
   is for you. If, however, you don't foresee yourself participating with
   Subversion at such a level, feel free to skip this chapter with the
   confidence that your experience as a Subversion user will not be
   affected.

Layered Library Design

   Each of Subversion's core libraries can be said to exist in one of
   three main layersâthe Repository layer, the Repository Access (RA)
   layer, or the Client layer (see Figure 1, âSubversion's architectureâ
   in the Preface). We will examine these layers shortly, but first, let's
   briefly summarize Subversion's various libraries. For the sake of
   consistency, we will refer to the libraries by their extensionless Unix
   library names (libsvn_fs, libsvn_wc, mod_dav_svn, etc.).

   libsvn_client
          Primary interface for client programs

   libsvn_delta
          Tree and byte-stream differencing routines

   libsvn_diff
          Contextual differencing and merging routines

   libsvn_fs
          Filesystem commons and module loader

   libsvn_fs_base
          The Berkeley DB filesystem backend

   libsvn_fs_fs
          The native filesystem (FSFS) backend

   libsvn_ra
          Repository Access commons and module loader

   libsvn_ra_local
          The local Repository Access module

   libsvn_ra_neon
          The WebDAV Repository Access module

   libsvn_ra_serf
          Another (experimental) WebDAV Repository Access module

   libsvn_ra_svn
          The custom protocol Repository Access module

   libsvn_repos
          Repository interface

   libsvn_subr
          Miscellaneous helpful subroutines

   libsvn_wc
          The working copy management library

   mod_authz_svn
          Apache authorization module for Subversion repositories access
          via WebDAV

   mod_dav_svn
          Apache module for mapping WebDAV operations to Subversion ones

   The fact that the word âmiscellaneousâ appears only once in the
   previous list is a good sign. The Subversion development team is
   serious about making sure that functionality lives in the right layer
   and libraries. Perhaps the greatest advantage of the modular design is
   its lack of complexity from a developer's point of view. As a
   developer, you can quickly formulate that kind of âbig pictureâ that
   allows you to pinpoint the location of certain pieces of functionality
   with relative ease.

   Another benefit of modularity is the ability to replace a given module
   with a whole new library that implements the same API without affecting
   the rest of the code base. In some sense, this happens within
   Subversion already. The libsvn_ra_local, libsvn_ra_neon,
   libsvn_ra_serf, and libsvn_ra_svn libraries each implement the same
   interface, all working as plug-ins to libsvn_ra. And all four
   communicate with the Repository layerâlibsvn_ra_local connects to the
   repository directly; the other three do so over a network. The
   libsvn_fs_base and libsvn_fs_fs libraries are another pair of libraries
   that implement the same functionality in different waysâboth are
   plug-ins to the common libsvn_fs library.

   The client itself also highlights the benefits of modularity in the
   Subversion design. Subversion's libsvn_client library is a one-stop
   shop for most of the functionality necessary for designing a working
   Subversion client (see the section called âClient Layerâ). So while the
   Subversion distribution provides only the svn command-line client
   program, several third-party programs provide various forms of
   graphical client UIs. These GUIs use the same APIs that the stock
   command-line client does. This type of modularity has played a large
   role in the proliferation of available Subversion clients and IDE
   integrations and, by extension, to the tremendous adoption rate of
   Subversion itself.

Repository Layer

   When referring to Subversion's Repository layer, we're generally
   talking about two basic conceptsâthe versioned filesystem
   implementation (accessed via libsvn_fs, and supported by its
   libsvn_fs_base and libsvn_fs_fs plug-ins), and the repository logic
   that wraps it (as implemented in libsvn_repos). These libraries provide
   the storage and reporting mechanisms for the various revisions of your
   version-controlled data. This layer is connected to the Client layer
   via the Repository Access layer, and is, from the perspective of the
   Subversion user, the stuff at the âother end of the line.â

   The Subversion filesystem is not a kernel-level filesystem that one
   would install in an operating system (such as the Linux ext2 or NTFS),
   but instead is a virtual filesystem. Rather than storing âfilesâ and
   âdirectoriesâ as real files and directories (the kind you can navigate
   through using your favorite shell program), it uses one of two
   available abstract storage backendsâeither a Berkeley DB database
   environment or a flat-file representation. (To learn more about the two
   repository backends, see the section called âChoosing a Data Storeâ.)
   There has even been considerable interest by the development community
   in giving future releases of Subversion the ability to use other
   backend database systems, perhaps through a mechanism such as Open
   Database Connectivity (ODBC). In fact, Google did something similar to
   this before launching the Google Code Project Hosting service: they
   announced in mid-2006 that members of its open source team had written
   a new proprietary Subversion filesystem plug-in that used Google's
   ultra-scalable Bigtable database for its storage.

   The filesystem API exported by libsvn_fs contains the kinds of
   functionality you would expect from any other filesystem APIâyou can
   create and remove files and directories, copy and move them around,
   modify file contents, and so on. It also has features that are not
   quite as common, such as the ability to add, modify, and remove
   metadata (âpropertiesâ) on each file or directory. Furthermore, the
   Subversion filesystem is a versioning filesystem, which means that as
   you make changes to your directory tree, Subversion remembers what your
   tree looked like before those changes. And before the previous changes.
   And the previous ones. And so on, all the way back through versioning
   time to (and just beyond) the moment you first started adding things to
   the filesystem.

   All the modifications you make to your tree are done within the context
   of a Subversion commit transaction. The following is a simplified
   general routine for modifying your filesystem:
    1. Begin a Subversion commit transaction.
    2. Make your changes (adds, deletes, property modifications, etc.).
    3. Commit your transaction.

   Once you have committed your transaction, your filesystem modifications
   are permanently stored as historical artifacts. Each of these cycles
   generates a single new revision of your tree, and each revision is
   forever accessible as an immutable snapshot of âthe way things were.â

   The Transaction Distraction

   The notion of a Subversion transaction can become easily confused with
   the transaction support provided by the underlying database itself,
   especially given the former's close proximity to the Berkeley DB
   database code in libsvn_fs_base. Both types of transaction exist to
   provide atomicity and isolation. In other words, transactions give you
   the ability to perform a set of actions in an all-or-nothing
   fashionâeither all the actions in the set complete with success, or
   they all get treated as though none of them ever happenedâand in a way
   that does not interfere with other processes acting on the data.

   Database transactions generally encompass small operations related
   specifically to the modification of data in the database itself (such
   as changing the contents of a table row). Subversion transactions are
   larger in scope, encompassing higher-level operations such as making
   modifications to a set of files and directories that are intended to be
   stored as the next revision of the filesystem tree. If that isn't
   confusing enough, consider the fact that Subversion uses a database
   transaction during the creation of a Subversion transaction (so that if
   the creation of a Subversion transaction fails, the database will look
   as though we had never attempted that creation in the first place)!

   Fortunately for users of the filesystem API, the transaction support
   provided by the database system itself is hidden almost entirely from
   view (as should be expected from a properly modularized library
   scheme). It is only when you start digging into the implementation of
   the filesystem itself that such things become visible (or interesting).

   Most of the functionality the filesystem interface provides deals with
   actions that occur on individual filesystem paths. That is, from
   outside the filesystem, the primary mechanism for describing and
   accessing the individual revisions of files and directories comes
   through the use of path strings such as /foo/bar, just as though you
   were addressing files and directories through your favorite shell
   program. You add new files and directories by passing their paths-to-be
   to the right API functions. You query for information about them by the
   same mechanism.

   Unlike most filesystems, though, a path alone is not enough information
   to identify a file or directory in Subversion. Think of a directory
   tree as a two-dimensional system, where a node's siblings represent a
   sort of left-and-right motion, and navigating into the node's
   subdirectories represents a downward motion. Figure 8.1, âFiles and
   directories in two dimensionsâ shows a typical representation of a tree
   as exactly that.

   Figure 8.1. Files and directories in two dimensions
   Files and directories in two dimensions

   The difference here is that the Subversion filesystem has a nifty third
   dimension that most filesystems do not haveâTime! ^[52] In the
   filesystem interface, nearly every function that has a path argument
   also expects a root argument. This svn_fs_root_t argument describes
   either a revision or a Subversion transaction (which is simply a
   revision in the making) and provides that third dimension of context
   needed to understand the difference between /foo/bar in revision 32,
   and the same path as it exists in revision 98. Figure 8.2, âVersioning
   timeâthe third dimension!â shows revision history as an added dimension
   to the Subversion filesystem universe.

   Figure 8.2. Versioning timeâthe third dimension!
   Versioning timeâthe third dimension!

   As we mentioned earlier, the libsvn_fs API looks and feels like any
   other filesystem, except that it has this wonderful versioning
   capability. It was designed to be usable by any program interested in a
   versioning filesystem. Not coincidentally, Subversion itself is
   interested in that functionality. But while the filesystem API should
   be sufficient for basic file and directory versioning support,
   Subversion wants moreâand that is where libsvn_repos comes in.

   The Subversion repository library (libsvn_repos) sits (logically
   speaking) atop the libsvn_fs API, providing additional functionality
   beyond that of the underlying versioned filesystem logic. It does not
   completely wrap each and every filesystem functionâonly certain major
   steps in the general cycle of filesystem activity are wrapped by the
   repository interface. Some of these include the creation and commit of
   Subversion transactions and the modification of revision properties.
   These particular events are wrapped by the repository layer because
   they have hooks associated with them. A repository hook system is not
   strictly related to implementing a versioning filesystem, so it lives
   in the repository wrapper library.

   The hooks mechanism is but one of the reasons for the abstraction of a
   separate repository library from the rest of the filesystem code. The
   libsvn_repos API provides several other important utilities to
   Subversion. These include the abilities to:
     * Create, open, destroy, and perform recovery steps on a Subversion
       repository and the filesystem included in that repository.
     * Describe the differences between two filesystem trees.
     * Query for the commit log messages associated with all (or some) of
       the revisions in which a set of files was modified in the
       filesystem.
     * Generate a human-readable âdumpâ of the filesystemâa complete
       representation of the revisions in the filesystem.
     * Parse that dump format, loading the dumped revisions into a
       different Subversion repository.

   As Subversion continues to evolve, the repository library will grow
   with the filesystem library to offer increased functionality and
   configurable option support.

Repository Access Layer

   If the Subversion Repository layer is at âthe other end of the line,â
   the Repository Access (RA) layer is the line itself. Charged with
   marshaling data between the client libraries and the repository, this
   layer includes the libsvn_ra module loader library, the RA modules
   themselves (which currently includes libsvn_ra_neon, libsvn_ra_local,
   libsvn_ra_serf, and libsvn_ra_svn), and any additional libraries needed
   by one or more of those RA modules (such as the mod_dav_svn Apache
   module or libsvn_ra_svn's server, svnserve).

   Since Subversion uses URLs to identify its repository resources, the
   protocol portion of the URL scheme (usually file://, http://, https://,
   svn://, or svn+ssh://) is used to determine which RA module will handle
   the communications. Each module registers a list of the protocols it
   knows how to âspeakâ so that the RA loader can, at runtime, determine
   which module to use for the task at hand. You can determine which RA
   modules are available to the Subversion command-line client, and what
   protocols they claim to support, by running svn --version:
$ svn --version

The following repository access (RA) modules are available:

* ra_neon : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV protocol using Neon.
  - handles 'http' scheme

  - handles 'file' scheme
* ra_serf : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV protocol using serf.
  - handles 'http' scheme
  - handles 'https' scheme

$

   The public API exported by the RA layer contains functionality
   necessary for sending and receiving versioned data to and from the
   repository. And each of the available RA plug-ins is able to perform
   that task using a specific protocolâlibsvn_ra_dav speaks HTTP/WebDAV
   (optionally using SSL encryption) with an Apache HTTP Server that is
   running the mod_dav_svn Subversion server module; libsvn_ra_svn speaks
   a custom network protocol with the svnserve program; and so on.

   For those who wish to access a Subversion repository using still
   another protocol, that is precisely why the Repository Access layer is
   modularized! Developers can simply write a new library that implements
   the RA interface on one side and communicates with the repository on
   the other. Your new library can use existing network protocols or you
   can invent your own. You could use interprocess communication (IPC)
   calls, orâlet's get crazy, shall we?âyou could even implement an
   email-based protocol. Subversion supplies the APIs; you supply the
   creativity.

Client Layer

   On the client side, the Subversion working copy is where all the action
   takes place. The bulk of functionality implemented by the client-side
   libraries exists for the sole purpose of managing working
   copiesâdirectories full of files and other subdirectories that serve as
   a sort of local, editable âreflectionâ of one or more repository
   locationsâand propagating changes to and from the Repository Access
   layer.

   Subversion's working copy library, libsvn_wc, is directly responsible
   for managing the data in the working copies. To accomplish this, the
   library stores administrative information about each working copy
   directory within a special subdirectory. This subdirectory, named .svn,
   is present in each working copy directory and contains various other
   files and directories that record state and provide a private workspace
   for administrative action. For those familiar with CVS, this .svn
   subdirectory is similar in purpose to the CVS administrative
   directories found in CVS working copies. For more information about the
   .svn administrative area, see the section called âInside the Working
   Copy Administration Areaâ later in this chapter.

   The Subversion client library, libsvn_client, has the broadest
   responsibility; its job is to mingle the functionality of the working
   copy library with that of the Repository Access layer, and then to
   provide the highest-level API to any application that wishes to perform
   general revision control actions. For example, the function
   svn_client_checkout() takes a URL as an argument. It passes this URL to
   the RA layer and opens an authenticated session with a particular
   repository. It then asks the repository for a certain tree, and sends
   this tree into the working copy library, which then writes a full
   working copy to disk (.svn directories and all).

   The client library is designed to be used by any application. While the
   Subversion source code includes a standard command-line client, it
   should be very easy to write any number of GUI clients on top of the
   client library. New GUIs (or any new client, really) for Subversion
   need not be clunky wrappers around the included command-line
   clientâthey have full access via the libsvn_client API to the same
   functionality, data, and callback mechanisms that the command-line
   client uses. In fact, the Subversion source code tree contains a small
   C program (which you can find at tools/examples/minimal_client.c) that
   exemplifies how to wield the Subversion API to create a simple client
   program.

   Binding DirectlyâA Word About Correctness

   Why should your GUI program bind directly with a libsvn_client instead
   of acting as a wrapper around a command-line program? Besides simply
   being more efficient, it can be more correct as well. A command-line
   program (such as the one supplied with Subversion) that binds to the
   client library needs to effectively translate feedback and requested
   data bits from C types to some form of human-readable output. This type
   of translation can be lossy. That is, the program may not display all
   of the information harvested from the API or may combine bits of
   information for compact representation.

   If you wrap such a command-line program with yet another program, the
   second program has access only to already interpreted (and as we
   mentioned, likely incomplete) information, which it must again
   translate into its representation format. With each layer of wrapping,
   the integrity of the original data is potentially tainted more and
   more, much like the result of making a copy of a copy (of a copyâ¦) of a
   favorite audio or video cassette.

   But the most compelling argument for binding directly to the APIs
   instead of wrapping other programs is that the Subversion project makes
   compatibility promises regarding its APIs. Across minor versions of
   those APIs (such as between 1.3 and 1.4), no function's prototype will
   change. In other words, you aren't forced to update your program's
   source code simply because you've upgraded to a new version of
   Subversion. Certain functions might be deprecated, but they still work,
   and this gives you a buffer of time to eventually embrace the newer
   APIs. These kinds of compatibility promises do not exist for Subversion
   command-line program output, which is subject to change from release to
   release.

Inside the Working Copy Administration Area

   As we mentioned earlier, each directory of a Subversion working copy
   contains a special subdirectory called .svn that houses administrative
   data about that working copy directory. Subversion uses the information
   in .svn to keep track of things such as:
     * Which repository location(s) are represented by the files and
       subdirectories in the working copy directory
     * What revision of each of those files and directories is currently
       present in the working copy
     * Any user-defined properties that might be attached to those files
       and directories
     * Pristine (unedited) copies of the working copy files

   The Subversion working copy administration area's layout and contents
   are considered implementation details not really intended for human
   consumption. Developers are encouraged to use Subversion's public APIs,
   or the tools that Subversion provides, to access and manipulate the
   working copy data, instead of directly reading or modifying those
   files. The file formats employed by the working copy library for its
   administrative data do change from time to timeâa fact that the public
   APIs do a great job of hiding from the average user. In this section,
   we expose some of these implementation details sheerly to appease your
   overwhelming curiosity.

The Entries File

   Perhaps the single most important file in the .svn directory is the
   entries file. It contains the bulk of the administrative information
   about the versioned items in a working copy directory. This one file
   tracks the repository URLs, pristine revision, file checksums, pristine
   text and property timestamps, scheduling and conflict state
   information, last-known commit information (author, revision,
   timestamp), local copy historyâpractically everything that a Subversion
   client is interested in knowing about a versioned (or to-be-versioned)
   resource!

   Folks familiar with CVS's administrative directories will have
   recognized at this point that Subversion's .svn/entries file serves the
   purposes of, among other things, CVS's CVS/Entries, CVS/Root, and
   CVS/Repository files combined.

   The format of the .svn/entries file has changed over time. Originally
   an XML file, it now uses a customâthough still human-readableâfile
   format. While XML was a great choice for early developers of Subversion
   who were frequently debugging the file's contents (and Subversion's
   behavior in light of them), the need for easy developer debugging has
   diminished as Subversion has matured and has been replaced by the
   user's need for snappier performance. Be aware that Subversion's
   working copy library automatically upgrades working copies from one
   format to anotherâit reads the old formats and writes the newâwhich
   saves you the hassle of checking out a new working copy, but can also
   complicate situations where different versions of Subversion might be
   trying to use the same working copy.

Pristine Copies and Property Files

   As mentioned before, the .svn directory also holds the pristine
   âtext-baseâ versions of files. You can find those in .svn/text-base.
   The benefits of these pristine copies are multipleânetwork-free checks
   for local modifications and difference reporting, network-free
   reversion of modified or missing files, more efficient transmission of
   changes to the serverâbut they come at the cost of having each
   versioned file stored at least twice on disk. These days, this seems to
   be a negligible penalty for most files. However, the situation gets
   uglier as the size of your versioned files grows. Some attention is
   being given to making the presence of the âtext-baseâ an option.
   Ironically, though, it is as your versioned files' sizes get larger
   that the existence of the âtext-baseâ becomes more crucialâwho wants to
   transmit a huge file across a network just because she wants to commit
   a tiny change to it?

   Similar in purpose to the âtext-baseâ files are the property files and
   their pristine âprop-baseâ copies, located in .svn/props and
   .svn/prop-base, respectively. Since directories can have properties
   too, there are also .svn/dir-props and .svn/dir-prop-base files.

Using the APIs

   Developing applications against the Subversion library APIs is fairly
   straightforward. Subversion is primarily a set of C libraries, with
   header (.h) files that live in the subversion/include directory of the
   source tree. These headers are copied into your system locations (e.g.,
   /usr/local/include) when you build and install Subversion itself from
   source. These headers represent the entirety of the functions and types
   meant to be accessible by users of the Subversion libraries. The
   Subversion developer community is meticulous about ensuring that the
   public API is well documentedârefer directly to the header files for
   that documentation.

   When examining the public header files, the first thing you might
   notice is that Subversion's datatypes and functions are
   namespace-protected. That is, every public Subversion symbol name
   begins with svn_, followed by a short code for the library in which the
   symbol is defined (such as wc, client, fs, etc.), followed by a single
   underscore (_), and then the rest of the symbol name. Semipublic
   functions (used among source files of a given library but not by code
   outside that library, and found inside the library directories
   themselves) differ from this naming scheme in that instead of a single
   underscore after the library code, they use a double underscore (_â_).
   Functions that are private to a given source file have no special
   prefixing and are declared static. Of course, a compiler isn't
   interested in these naming conventions, but they help to clarify the
   scope of a given function or datatype.

   Another good source of information about programming against the
   Subversion APIs is the project's own hacking guidelines, which you can
   find at http://subversion.tigris.org/hacking.html. This document
   contains useful information, which, while aimed at developers and
   would-be developers of Subversion itself, is equally applicable to
   folks developing against Subversion as a set of third-party libraries.
   ^[53]

The Apache Portable Runtime Library

   Along with Subversion's own datatypes, you will see many references to
   datatypes that begin with apr_âsymbols from the Apache Portable Runtime
   (APR) library. APR is Apache's portability library, originally carved
   out of its server code as an attempt to separate the OS-specific bits
   from the OS-independent portions of the code. The result was a library
   that provides a generic API for performing operations that differ
   mildlyâor wildlyâfrom OS to OS. While the Apache HTTP Server was
   obviously the first user of the APR library, the Subversion developers
   immediately recognized the value of using APR as well. This means that
   there is practically no OS-specific code in Subversion itself. Also, it
   means that the Subversion client compiles and runs anywhere that the
   Apache HTTP Server does. Currently, this list includes all flavors of
   Unix, Win32, BeOS, OS/2, and Mac OS X.

   In addition to providing consistent implementations of system calls
   that differ across operating systems, ^[54] APR gives Subversion
   immediate access to many custom datatypes, such as dynamic arrays and
   hash tables. Subversion uses these types extensively. But perhaps the
   most pervasive APR datatype, found in nearly every Subversion API
   prototype, is the apr_pool_tâthe APR memory pool. Subversion uses pools
   internally for all its memory allocation needs (unless an external
   library requires a different memory management mechanism for data
   passed through its API), ^[55] and while a person coding against the
   Subversion APIs is not required to do the same, she is required to
   provide pools to the API functions that need them. This means that
   users of the Subversion API must also link against APR, must call
   apr_initialize() to initialize the APR subsystem, and then must create
   and manage pools for use with Subversion API calls, typically by using
   svn_pool_create(), svn_pool_clear(), and svn_pool_destroy().

   Programming with Memory Pools

   Almost every developer who has used the C programming language has at
   some point sighed at the daunting task of managing memory usage.
   Allocating enough memory to use, keeping track of those allocations,
   freeing the memory when you no longer need itâthese tasks can be quite
   complex. And of course, failure to do those things properly can result
   in a program that crashes itself, or worse, crashes the computer.

   Higher-level languages, on the other hand, either take the job of
   memory management away from you completely or make it something you toy
   with only when doing extremely tight program optimization. Languages
   such as Java and Python use garbage collection, allocating memory for
   objects when needed, and automatically freeing that memory when the
   object is no longer in use.

   APR provides a middle-ground approach called pool-based memory
   management. It allows the developer to control memory usage at a lower
   resolutionâper chunk (or âpoolâ) of memory, instead of per allocated
   object. Rather than using malloc() and friends to allocate enough
   memory for a given object, you ask APR to allocate the memory from a
   memory pool. When you're finished using the objects you've created in
   the pool, you destroy the entire pool, effectively de-allocating the
   memory consumed by all the objects you allocated from it. Thus, rather
   than keeping track of individual objects that need to be de-allocated,
   your program simply considers the general lifetimes of those objects
   and allocates the objects in a pool whose lifetime (the time between
   the pool's creation and its deletion) matches the object's needs.

URL and Path Requirements

   With remote version control operation as the whole point of
   Subversion's existence, it makes sense that some attention has been
   paid to internationalization (i18n) support. After all, while âremoteâ
   might mean âacross the office,â it could just as well mean âacross the
   globe.â To facilitate this, all of Subversion's public interfaces that
   accept path arguments expect those paths to be canonicalizedâwhich is
   most easily accomplished by passing them through the
   svn_path_canonicalize() functionâand encoded in UTF-8. This means, for
   example, that any new client binary that drives the libsvn_client
   interface needs to first convert paths from the locale-specific
   encoding to UTF-8 before passing those paths to the Subversion
   libraries, and then reconvert any resultant output paths from
   Subversion back into the locale's encoding before using those paths for
   non-Subversion purposes. Fortunately, Subversion provides a suite of
   functions (see subversion/include/svn_utf.h) that any program can use
   to do these conversions.

   Also, Subversion APIs require all URL parameters to be properly
   URI-encoded. So, instead of passing file:///home/username/My File.txt
   as the URL of a file named My File.txt, you need to pass
   file:///home/username/My%20File.txt. Again, Subversion supplies helper
   functions that your application can useâsvn_path_uri_encode() and
   svn_path_uri_decode(), for URI encoding and decoding, respectively.

Using Languages Other Than C and C++

   If you are interested in using the Subversion libraries in conjunction
   with something other than a C programâsay, a Python or Perl
   scriptâSubversion has some support for this via the Simplified Wrapper
   and Interface Generator (SWIG). The SWIG bindings for Subversion are
   located in subversion/bindings/swig. They are still maturing, but they
   are usable. These bindings allow you to call Subversion API functions
   indirectly, using wrappers that translate the datatypes native to your
   scripting language into the datatypes needed by Subversion's C
   libraries.

   Significant efforts have been made toward creating functional
   SWIG-generated bindings for Python, Perl, and Ruby. To some extent, the
   work done preparing the SWIG interface files for these languages is
   reusable in efforts to generate bindings for other languages supported
   by SWIG (which include versions of C#, Guile, Java, MzScheme, OCaml,
   PHP, and Tcl, among others). However, some extra programming is
   required to compensate for complex APIs that SWIG needs some help
   translating between languages. For more information on SWIG itself, see
   the project's web site at http://www.swig.org/.

   Subversion also has language bindings for Java. The javahl bindings
   (located in subversion/bindings/java in the Subversion source tree)
   aren't SWIG-based, but are instead a mixture of Java and hand-coded
   JNI. Javahl covers most Subversion client-side APIs and is specifically
   targeted at implementors of Java-based Subversion clients and IDE
   integrations.

   Subversion's language bindings tend to lack the level of developer
   attention given to the core Subversion modules, but can generally be
   trusted as production-ready. A number of scripts and applications,
   alternative Subversion GUI clients, and other third-party tools are
   successfully using Subversion's language bindings today to accomplish
   their Subversion integrations.

   It's worth noting here that there are other options for interfacing
   with Subversion using other languages: alternative bindings for
   Subversion that aren't provided by the Subversion development community
   at all. You can find links to these alternative bindings on the
   Subversion project's links page (at
   http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html), but there are a couple of
   popular ones we feel are especially noteworthy. First, Barry Scott's
   PySVN bindings (http://pysvn.tigris.org/) are a popular option for
   binding with Python. PySVN boasts of a more Pythonic interface than the
   more C-like APIs provided by Subversion's own Python bindings. And if
   you're looking for a pure Java implementation of Subversion, check out
   SVNKit (http://svnkit.com/), which is Subversion rewritten from the
   ground up in Java.

   SVNKit Versus javahl

   In 2005, a small company called TMate announced the 1.0.0 release of
   JavaSVNâa pure Java implementation of Subversion. Since then, the
   project has been renamed to SVNKit (available at http://svnkit.com/)
   and has seen great success as a provider of Subversion functionality to
   various Subversion clients, IDE integrations, and other third-party
   tools.

   The SVNKit library is interesting in that, unlike the javahl library,
   it is not merely a wrapper around the official Subversion core
   libraries. In fact, it shares no code with Subversion at all. But while
   it is easy to confuse SVNKit with javahl, and easier still to not even
   realize which of these libraries you are using, folks should be aware
   that SVNKit differs from javahl in some significant ways. First, SVNKit
   is not developed as open source software and seems to have at any given
   time only a few developers working on it. Also, SVNKit's license is
   more restrictive than that of Subversion. Finally, by aiming to be a
   pure Java Subversion library, SVNKit is limited in which portions of
   Subversion can be reasonably cloned while still keeping up with
   Subversion's releases. This has already happened onceâSVNKit cannot
   access BDB-backed Subversion repositories via the file:// protocol
   because there's no pure Java implementation of Berkeley DB that is
   file-format-compatible with the native implementation of that library.

   That said, SVNKit has a well-established track record of reliability.
   And a pure Java solution is much more robust in the face of programming
   errorsâa bug in SVNKit might raise a catchable Java Exception, but a
   bug in the Subversion core libraries as accessed via javahl can bring
   down your entire Java Runtime Environment. So, weigh the costs when
   choosing a Java-based Subversion implementation.

Code Samples

   Example 8.1, âUsing the Repository Layerâ contains a code segment
   (written in C) that illustrates some of the concepts we've been
   discussing. It uses both the repository and filesystem interfaces (as
   can be determined by the prefixes svn_repos_ and svn_fs_ of the
   function names, respectively) to create a new revision in which a
   directory is added. You can see the use of an APR pool, which is passed
   around for memory allocation purposes. Also, the code reveals a
   somewhat obscure fact about Subversion error handlingâall Subversion
   errors must be explicitly handled to avoid memory leakage (and in some
   cases, application failure).

   Example 8.1. Using the Repository Layer
/* Convert a Subversion error into a simple boolean error code.

 * NOTE:  Subversion errors must be cleared (using svn_error_clear())
 *        because they are allocated from the global pool, else memory

}

   Note that in Example 8.1, âUsing the Repository Layerâ, the code could
   just as easily have committed the transaction using
   svn_fs_commit_txn(). But the filesystem API knows nothing about the
   repository library's hook mechanism. If you want your Subversion
   repository to automatically perform some set of non-Subversion tasks
   every time you commit a transaction (e.g., sending an email that
   describes all the changes made in that transaction to your developer
   mailing list), you need to use the libsvn_repos-wrapped version of that
   function, which adds the hook triggering functionalityâin this case,
   svn_repos_fs_commit_txn(). (For more information regarding Subversion's
   repository hooks, see the section called âImplementing Repository
   Hooksâ.)

   Now let's switch languages. Example 8.2, âUsing the Repository layer
   with Pythonâ is a sample program that uses Subversion's SWIG Python
   bindings to recursively crawl the youngest repository revision, and to
   print the various paths reached during the crawl.

   Example 8.2. Using the Repository layer with Python
#!/usr/bin/python

    a list of all the paths at or below DIRECTORY."""

    # Print the name of this path.
    print directory + "/"

    # Get the directory entries for DIRECTORY.
    entries = svn.fs.svn_fs_dir_entries(root, directory)

    # Loop over the entries.
    names = entries.keys()
    for name in names:
        # Calculate the entry's full path.

        # If the entry is a directory, recurse.  The recursion will return
        # a list with the entry and all its children, which we will add to
        # our running list of paths.
        if svn.fs.svn_fs_is_dir(root, full_path):
            crawl_filesystem_dir(root, full_path)
        else:

    fs_obj = svn.repos.svn_repos_fs(repos_obj)

    # Query the current youngest revision.
    youngest_rev = svn.fs.svn_fs_youngest_rev(fs_obj)

    # Open a root object representing the youngest (HEAD) revision.
    root_obj = svn.fs.svn_fs_revision_root(fs_obj, youngest_rev)

    # Do the recursive crawl.
    crawl_filesystem_dir(root_obj, "")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Check for sane usage.
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        sys.stderr.write("Usage: %s REPOS_PATH\n"
                         % (os.path.basename(sys.argv[0])))
        sys.exit(1)

    # Canonicalize the repository path.
    repos_path = svn.core.svn_path_canonicalize(sys.argv[1])

    # Do the real work.
    crawl_youngest(repos_path)

   This same program in C would need to deal with APR's memory pool
   system. But Python handles memory usage automatically, and Subversion's
   Python bindings adhere to that convention. In C, you'd be working with
   custom datatypes (such as those provided by the APR library) for
   representing the hash of entries and the list of paths, but Python has
   hashes (called âdictionariesâ) and lists as built-in datatypes, and it
   provides a rich collection of functions for operating on those types.
   So SWIG (with the help of some customizations in Subversion's language
   bindings layer) takes care of mapping those custom datatypes into the
   native datatypes of the target language. This provides a more intuitive
   interface for users of that language.

   The Subversion Python bindings can be used for working copy operations,
   too. In the previous section of this chapter, we mentioned the
   libsvn_client interface and how it exists for the sole purpose of
   simplifying the process of writing a Subversion client. Example 8.3, âA
   Python status crawlerâ is a brief example of how that library can be
   accessed via the SWIG Python bindings to re-create a scaled-down
   version of the svn status command.

        sys.stderr.write("Error (%d): %s\n" % (e.apr_err, e.message))
        sys.exit(1)

   As was the case in Example 8.2, âUsing the Repository layer with
   Pythonâ, this program is pool-free and uses, for the most part, normal
   Python datatypes. The call to svn_client_ctx_t() is deceiving because
   the public Subversion API has no such functionâthis just happens to be
   a case where SWIG's automatic language generation bleeds through a
   little bit (the function is a sort of factory function for Python's
   version of the corresponding complex C structure). Also note that the
   path passed to this program (like the last one) gets run through
   svn_path_canonicalize(), because to not do so runs the risk of
   triggering the underlying Subversion C library's assertions about such
   things, which translates into rather immediate and unceremonious
   program abortion.

Summary

   One of Subversion's greatest features isn't something you get from
   running its command-line client or other tools. It's the fact that
   Subversion was designed modularly and provides a stable, public API so
   that othersâlike yourself, perhapsâcan write custom software that
   drives Subversion's core logic.

   In this chapter, we took a closer look at Subversion's architecture,
   examining its logical layers and describing that public API, the very
   same API that Subversion's own layers use to communicate with each
   other. Many developers have found interesting uses for the Subversion
   API, from simple repository hook scripts, to integrations between
   Subversion and some other application, to completely different version
   control systems. What unique itch will you scratch with it?

   This chapter is intended to be a complete reference to using
   Subversion. This includes the command-line client (svn) and all its
   subcommands, as well as the repository administration programs
   (svnadmin and svnlook) and their respective subcommands.

The Subversion Command-Line Client: svn

   To use the command-line client, type svn, the subcommand you wish to
   use, ^[58] and any options or targets that you wish to operate onâthe
   subcommand and the options need not appear in a specific order. For
   example, all of the following are valid ways to use svn status:
$ svn -v status
$ svn status -v
$ svn status -v myfile

   You can find many more examples of how to use most client commands in
   Chapter 2, Basic Usage and commands for managing properties in the
   section called âPropertiesâ.

svn Options

   While Subversion has different options for its subcommands, all options
   exist in a single namespaceâthat is, each option is guaranteed to mean
   the same thing regardless of the subcommand you use it with. For
   example, --verbose (-v) always means âverbose output,â regardless of
   the subcommand you use it with.

   The svn command-line client usually exits quickly with an error if you
   pass it an option which does not apply to the specified subcommand. But
   as of Subversion 1.5, several of the options which apply to allâor
   nearly allâof the subcommands have been deemed acceptable by all
   subcommands, even if they have no effect on some of them. They appear
   grouped together in the command-line client's usage messages as global
   options. This was done to assist folks who write scripts which wrap the
   command-line client. These global options are as follows:

   --config-dir DIR
          Instructs Subversion to read configuration information from the
          specified directory instead of the default location (.subversion
          in the user's home directory).

   --no-auth-cache
          Prevents caching of authentication information (e.g., username
          and password) in the Subversion runtime configuration
          directories.

   --non-interactive
          Disables all interactive prompting. Some examples of interactive
          prompting include requests for authentication credentials and
          conflict resolution decisions. This is useful if you're running
          Subversion inside an automated script and it's more appropriate
          to have Subversion fail than to prompt for more information.

   --password PASSWD
          Specifies the password to use when authenticating against a
          Subversion server. If not provided, or if incorrect, Subversion
          will prompt you for this information as needed.

   --username NAME
          Specifies the username to use when authenticating against a
          Subversion server. If not provided, or if incorrect, Subversion
          will prompt you for this information as needed.

   The rest of the options apply and are accepted by only a subset of the
   subcommand. They are as follows:

   --accept ACTION
          Specifies an action for automatic conflict resolution. Possible
          actions are postpone, base, mine-full, theirs-full, edit, and
          launch.

   --auto-props
          Enables auto-props, overriding the enable-auto-props directive
          in the config file.

   --change (-c) ARG
          Used as a means to refer to a specific âchangeâ (a.k.a. a
          revision). This option is syntactic sugar for â-r ARG-1:ARGâ.

   --changelist ARG
          Instructs Subversion to operate only on members of the
          changelist named ARG. You can use this option multiple times to
          specify sets of changelists.

   --cl ARG
          An alias for the --changelist option.

   --depth ARG
          Instructs Subversion to limit the scope of an operation to a
          particular tree depth. ARG is one of empty, files, immediates,
          or infinity.

   --diff-cmd CMD
          Specifies an external program to use to show differences between
          files. When svn diff is invoked without this option, it uses
          Subversion's internal diff engine, which provides unified diffs
          by default. If you want to use an external diff program, use
          --diff-cmd. You can pass options to the diff program with the
          --extensions (-x) option (more on that later in this section).

   --diff3-cmd CMD
          Specifies an external program to use to merge files.

   --dry-run
          Goes through all the motions of running a command, but makes no
          actual changesâeither on disk or in the repository.

   --editor-cmd CMD
          Specifies an external program to use to edit a log message or a
          property value. See the editor-cmd section in the section called
          âConfigâ for ways to specify a default editor.

   --encoding ENC
          Tells Subversion that your commit message is encoded in the
          charset provided. The default is your operating system's native
          locale, and you should specify the encoding if your commit
          message is in any other encoding.

   --extensions (-x) ARG
          Specifies an argument or arguments that Subversion should pass
          to an external diff command. This option is valid only when used
          with the svn diff or svn merge commands, with the --diff-cmd
          option. If you wish to pass multiple arguments, you must enclose
          all of them in quotes (e.g., svn diff --diff-cmd /usr/bin/diff
          -x "-b -E").

   --file (-F) FILENAME
          Uses the contents of the named file for the specified
          subcommand, though different subcommands do different things
          with this content. For example, svn commit uses the content as a
          commit log, whereas svn propset uses it as a property value.

   --force
          Forces a particular command or operation to run. Subversion will
          prevent you from performing some operations in normal usage, but
          you can pass the force option to tell Subversion âI know what
          I'm doing as well as the possible repercussions of doing it, so
          let me at 'em.â This option is the programmatic equivalent of
          doing your own electrical work with the power onâif you don't
          know what you're doing, you're likely to get a nasty shock.

   --force-log
          Forces a suspicious parameter passed to the --message (-m) or
          --file (-F) option to be accepted as valid. By default,
          Subversion will produce an error if parameters to these options
          look like they might instead be targets of the subcommand. For
          example, if you pass a versioned file's path to the --file (-F)
          option, Subversion will assume you've made a mistake, that the
          path was instead intended as the target of the operation, and
          that you simply failed to provide some otherâunversionedâfile as
          the source of your log message. To assert your intent and
          override these types of errors, pass the --force-log option to
          subcommands that accept log messages.

   --help (-h) or -?)
          If used with one or more subcommands, shows the built-in help
          text for each. If used alone, it displays the general client
          help text.

   --ignore-ancestry
          Tells Subversion to ignore ancestry when calculating differences
          (rely on path contents alone).

   --ignore-externals
          Tells Subversion to ignore externals definitions and the
          external working copies managed by them.

   --incremental
          Prints output in a format suitable for concatenation.

   --keep-changelists
          Tells Subversion not to delete changelists after committing.

   --keep-local
          Keeps the local copy of a file or directory (used with the svn
          delete command).

   --limit (-l) NUM
          Shows only the first NUM log messages.

   --message (-m) MESSAGE
          Indicates that you will specify either a log message or a lock
          comment on the command line, following this option. For example:

$ svn commit -m "They don't make Sunday."

   --new ARG
          Uses ARG as the newer target (for use with svn diff).

   --no-auto-props
          Disables auto-props, overriding the enable-auto-props directive
          in the config file.

   --no-diff-deleted
          Prevents Subversion from printing differences for deleted files.
          The default behavior when you remove a file is for svn diff to
          print the same differences that you would see if you had left
          the file but removed all the content.

   --no-ignore
          Shows files in the status listing that would normally be omitted
          since they match a pattern in the global-ignores configuration
          option or the svn:ignore property. See the section called
          âConfigâ and the section called âIgnoring Unversioned Itemsâ for
          more information.

   --no-unlock
          Tells Subversion not to automatically unlock files (the default
          commit behavior is to unlock all files listed as part of the
          commit). See the section called âLockingâ for more information.

   --non-recursive (-N)
          Deprecated. Stops a subcommand from recursing into
          subdirectories. Most subcommands recurse by default, but some
          subcommandsâusually those that have the potential to remove or
          undo your local modificationsâdo not.

   --notice-ancestry
          Pays attention to ancestry when calculating differences.

   --old ARG
          Uses ARG as the older target (for use with svn diff).

   --parents
          Creates and adds nonexistent or nonversioned parent
          subdirectories to the working copy or repository as part of an
          operation. This is useful for automatically creating multiple
          subdirectories where none currently exist. If performed on a
          URL, all the directories will be created in a single commit.

   --quiet (-q)
          Requests that the client print only essential information while
          performing an operation.

   --record-only
          Marks revisions as merged, for use with --revision (-r).

   --recursive (-R)
          Makes a subcommand recurse into subdirectories. Most subcommands
          recurse by default.

   --reintegrate
          Used with the svn merge subcommand, merges all of the source
          URL's changes into the working copy. See the section called
          âKeeping a Branch in Syncâ for details.

   --relocate FROM TO [PATH...]
          Used with the svn switch subcommand, changes the location of the
          repository that your working copy references. This is useful if
          the location of your repository changes and you have an existing
          working copy that you'd like to continue to use. See svn switch
          for an example.

   --remove ARG
          Disassociates ARG from a changelist

   --revision (-r) REV
          Indicates that you're going to supply a revision (or range of
          revisions) for a particular operation. You can provide revision
          numbers, keywords, or dates (in curly braces) as arguments to
          the revision option. If you wish to offer a range of revisions,
          you can provide two revisions separated by a colon. For example:

$ svn log -r 1729
$ svn log -r 1729:HEAD
$ svn log -r 1729:1744
$ svn log -r {2001-12-04}:{2002-02-17}
$ svn log -r 1729:{2002-02-17}

          See the section called âRevision Keywordsâ for more information.

   --revprop
          Operates on a revision property instead of a property specific
          to a file or directory. This option requires that you also pass
          a revision with the --revision (-r) option.

   --set-depth ARG
          Sets the sticky depth on a directory in a working copy to one of
          empty, files, immediates, or infinity.

   --show-revs ARG
          Used to make svn mergeinfo display either merged or eligible
          revisions.

   --show-updates (-u)
          Causes the client to display information about which files in
          your working copy are out of date. This doesn't actually update
          any of your filesâit just shows you which files will be updated
          if you then use svn update.

   --stop-on-copy
          Causes a Subversion subcommand that traverses the history of a
          versioned resource to stop harvesting that historical
          information when a copyâthat is, a location in history where
          that resource was copied from another location in the
          repositoryâis encountered.

   --strict
          Causes Subversion to use strict semantics, a notion that is
          rather vague unless talking about specific subcommands (namely,
          svn propget).

   --targets FILENAME
          Tells Subversion to get the list of files that you wish to
          operate on from the filename that you provide instead of listing
          all the files on the command line.

   --use-merge-history (-g)
          Uses or displays additional information from merge history.

   --verbose (-v)
          Requests that the client print out as much information as it can
          while running any subcommand. This may result in Subversion
          printing out additional fields, detailed information about every
          file, or additional information regarding its actions.

   --version
          Prints the client version info. This information includes not
          only the version number of the client, but also a listing of all
          repository access modules that the client can use to access a
          Subversion repository. With --quiet (-q) it prints only the
          version number in a compact form.

   --with-all-revprops
          Used with the --xml option to svn log, will retrieve and display
          all revision properties in the log output.

   --with-revprop ARG
          When used with any command that writes to the repository, sets
          the revision property, using the NAME=VALUE format, NAME to
          VALUE. When used with svn log in --xml mode, this displays the
          value of ARG in the log output.

   --xml
          Prints output in XML format.

svn Subcommands

   Here are the various subcommands for the svn program. For the sake of
   brevity, we omit the global options (described in the section called
   âsvn Optionsâ) from the subcommand descriptions which follow.

Name

   svn add â Add files, directories, or symbolic links.

Synopsis

svn add PATH...

Description

   Schedule files, directories, or symbolic links in your working copy for
   addition to the repository. They will be uploaded and added to the
   repository on your next commit. If you add something and change your
   mind before committing, you can unschedule the addition using svn
   revert.

Alternate names

   None

Changes

   Working copy

Accesses repository

   No

Options

--auto-props
--depth ARG
--force
--no-auto-props
--no-ignore
--parents
--quiet (-q)
--targets FILENAME

Examples

   To add a file to your working copy:
$ svn add foo.c
A         foo.c

   When adding a directory, the default behavior of svn add is to recurse:
$ svn add testdir
A         testdir
A         testdir/a
A         testdir/b
A         testdir/c
A         testdir/d

   You can add a directory without adding its contents:
$ svn add --depth=empty otherdir
A         otherdir

   Normally, the command svn add * will skip over any directories that are
   already under version control. Sometimes, however, you may want to add
   every unversioned object in your working copy, including those hiding
   deeper. Passing the --force option makes svn add recurse into versioned
   directories:
$ svn add * --force
A         foo.c
A         somedir/bar.c
A  (bin)  otherdir/docs/baz.doc
â¦
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svn blame â Show author and revision information inline for the
   specified files or URLs.

Synopsis

svn blame TARGET[@REV]...

Description

   Show author and revision information inline for the specified files or
   URLs. Each line of text is annotated at the beginning with the author
   (username) and the revision number for the last change to that line.

Alternate names

   praise, annotate, ann

Changes

   Nothing

Accesses repository

   Yes

Options

--extensions (-x) ARG
--force
--incremental
--revision (-r) REV
--use-merge-history (-g)
--verbose (-v)
--xml

Examples

   If you want to see blame-annotated source for readme.txt in your test
   repository:
$ svn blame http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test/readme.txt
     3      sally This is a README file.
     5      harry You should read this.

   Even if svn blame says that Harry last modified readme.txt in revision
   5, you'll have to examine exactly what the revision changed to be sure
   that Harry changed the context of the lineâhe may have adjusted just
   the whitespace.

   If you use the --xml option, you can get XML output describing the
   blame annotations, but not the contents of the lines themselves:
$ svn blame --xml http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test/readme.txt
<?xml version="1.0"?>

Name

   svn cat â Output the contents of the specified files or URLs.

Synopsis

svn cat TARGET[@REV]...

Description

   Output the contents of the specified files or URLs. For listing the
   contents of directories, see svn list later in this chapter.

Alternate names

   None

Changes

   Nothing

Accesses repository

   Yes

Options

--revision (-r) REV

Examples

   If you want to view readme.txt in your repository without checking it
   out:
$ svn cat http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test/readme.txt
This is a README file.
You should read this.

   [Tip]
   Tip

   If your working copy is out of date (or you have local modifications)
   and you want to see the HEAD revision of a file in your working copy,
   svn cat -r HEAD FILENAME will automatically fetch the HEAD revision of
   the specified path:
$ cat foo.c
This file is in my local working copy
and has changes that I've made.

$ svn cat -r HEAD foo.c
Latest revision fresh from the repository!
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svn changelist â Associate (or deassociate) local paths with a
   changelist.

Synopsis

changelist CLNAME TARGET...
changelist --remove TARGET...

Description

   Used for dividing files in a working copy into a changelist (logical
   named grouping) in order to allow users to easily work on multiple file
   collections within a single working copy.

Example

   Edit three files, add them to a changelist, then commit only files in
   that changelist:
$ svn changelist issue1729 foo.c bar.c baz.c
Path 'foo.c' is now a member of changelist 'issue1729'.
Path 'bar.c' is now a member of changelist 'issue1729'.
Path 'baz.c' is now a member of changelist 'issue1729'.

$ svn status

A      test/sometest.c

--- Changelist 'issue1729':
A      foo.c
A      bar.c
A      baz.c

$ svn commit --changelist issue1729 -m "Fixing Issue 1729."
Adding         bar.c
Adding         baz.c
Adding         foo.c
Transmitting file data ...
Committed revision 2.

$ svn status
A      someotherfile.c
A      test/sometest.c

   Note that only the files in changelist issue1729 were committed.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svn checkout â Check out a working copy from a repository.

Synopsis

svn checkout URL[@REV]... [PATH]

Description

   Check out a working copy from a repository. If PATH is omitted, the
   basename of the URL will be used as the destination. If multiple URLs
   are given, each will be checked out into a subdirectory of PATH, with
   the name of the subdirectory being the basename of the URL.

Alternate names

   co

Changes

   Creates a working copy

Accesses repository

   Yes

Options

--depth ARG
--force
--ignore-externals
--quiet (-q)
--revision (-r) REV

Examples

   Check out a working copy into a directory called mine:
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos/test mine
A  mine/a
A  mine/b
A  mine/c
A  mine/d
Checked out revision 20.
$ ls
mine

   Check out two different directories into two separate working copies:
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos/test  file:///var/svn/repos/quiz
A  test/a
A  test/b
A  test/c
A  test/d
Checked out revision 20.
A  quiz/l
A  quiz/m
Checked out revision 13.
$ ls
quiz  test

   Check out two different directories into two separate working copies,
   but place both into a directory called working-copies:
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos/test  file:///var/svn/repos/quiz working-co
pies
A  working-copies/test/a
A  working-copies/test/b
A  working-copies/test/c
A  working-copies/test/d
Checked out revision 20.
A  working-copies/quiz/l
A  working-copies/quiz/m
Checked out revision 13.
$ ls
working-copies

   If you interrupt a checkout (or something else interrupts your
   checkout, such as loss of connectivity, etc.), you can restart it
   either by issuing the identical checkout command again or by updating
   the incomplete working copy:
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos/test mine
A  mine/a
A  mine/b
^C
svn: The operation was interrupted
svn: caught SIGINT

$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos/test mine
A  mine/c
^C
svn: The operation was interrupted
svn: caught SIGINT

$ svn update mine
A  mine/d
Updated to revision 20.

   If you wish to check out some revision other than the most recent one,
   you can do so by providing the --revision (-r) option to the svn
   checkout command:
$ svn checkout -r 2 file:///var/svn/repos/test mine
A  mine/a
Checked out revision 2.

Name

   svn cleanup â Recursively clean up the working copy

Synopsis

svn cleanup [PATH...]

Description

   Recursively clean up the working copy, removing working copy locks and
   resuming unfinished operations. If you ever get a working copy locked
   error, run this command to remove stale locks and get your working copy
   into a usable state again.

   If, for some reason, an svn update fails due to a problem running an
   external diff program (e.g., user input or network failure), pass the
   --diff3-cmd to allow cleanup to complete any merging with your external
   diff program. You can also specify any configuration directory with the
   --config-dir option, but you should need these options extremely
   infrequently.

Alternate names

Accesses repository

   No

Options

--diff3-cmd CMD

Examples

   Well, there's not much to the examples here, as svn cleanup generates
   no output. If you pass no PATH, then â.â is used:
$ svn cleanup

$ svn cleanup /var/svn/working-copy
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svn commit â Send changes from your working copy to the repository.

Synopsis

svn commit [PATH...]

Description

   Send changes from your working copy to the repository. If you do not
   supply a log message with your commit by using either the --file (-F)
   or --message (-m) option, svn will launch your editor for you to
   compose a commit message. See the editor-cmd list entry in the section
   called âConfigâ.

   svn commit will send any lock tokens that it finds and will release
   locks on all PATHs committed (recursively) unless --no-unlock is
   passed.
   [Tip]
   Tip

   If you begin a commit and Subversion launches your editor to compose
   the commit message, you can still abort without committing your
   changes. If you want to cancel your commit, just quit your editor
   without saving your commit message and Subversion will prompt you to
   either abort the commit, continue with no message, or edit the message
   again.

Alternate names

   ci (short for âcheck inâ; not co, which is an alias for the checkout
   subcommand)

Changes

   Working copy; repository

Accesses repository

   Yes

Options

--changelist ARG
--depth ARG
--editor-cmd CMD
--encoding ENC
--file (-F) FILENAME
--force-log
--keep-changelists
--message (-m) MESSAGE
--no-unlock
--quiet (-q)
--targets FILENAME
--with-revprop ARG

Examples

   Commit a simple modification to a file with the commit message on the
   command line and an implicit target of your current directory (â.â):
$ svn commit -m "added howto section."
Sending        a
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 3.

   Commit a modification to the file foo.c (explicitly specified on the
   command line) with the commit message in a file named msg:
$ svn commit -F msg foo.c
Sending        foo.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 5.

   If you want to use a file that's under version control for your commit
   message with --file (-F), you need to pass the --force-log option:
$ svn commit -F file_under_vc.txt foo.c
svn: The log message file is under version control
svn: Log message file is a versioned file; use '--force-log' to override

$ svn commit --force-log -F file_under_vc.txt foo.c
Sending        foo.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 6.

   To commit a file scheduled for deletion:
$ svn commit -m "removed file 'c'."
Deleting       c

Committed revision 7.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svn copy â Copy a file or directory in a working copy or in the
   repository.

Synopsis

svn copy SRC[@REV]... DST

Description

   Copy one or more files in a working copy or in the repository. When
   copying multiple sources, they will be added as children of DST, which
   must be a directory. SRC and DST can each be either a working copy (WC)
   path or URL:

   WC â WC
          Copy and schedule an item for addition (with history).

   WC â URL
          Immediately commit a copy of WC to URL.

   URL â WC
          Check out URL into WC and schedule it for addition.

   URL â URL
          Complete server-side copy. This is usually used to branch and
          tag.

   When copying multiple sources, they will be added as children of DST,
   which must be a directory.

   If no peg revision (i.e., @REV) is supplied, by default the BASE
   revision will be used for files copied from the working copy, while the
   HEAD revision will be used for files copied from a URL.
   [Note]
   Note

   You can only copy files within a single repository. Subversion does not
   support cross-repository copying.

Alternate names

   cp

Changes

   Repository if destination is a URL; working copy if destination is a WC
   path

Accesses repository

   Yes, if source or destination is in the repository, or if needed to
   look up the source revision number.

Options

--editor-cmd CMD
--encoding ENC
--file (-F) FILENAME
--force-log
--ignore-externals
--message (-m) MESSAGE
--parents
--quiet (-q)
--revision (-r) REV
--with-revprop ARG

Examples

   Copy an item within your working copy (this schedules the copyânothing
   goes into the repository until you commit):
$ svn copy foo.txt bar.txt
A         bar.txt
$ svn status
A  +   bar.txt

   Copy several files in a working copy into a subdirectory:
$ svn copy bat.c baz.c qux.c src
A         src/bat.c
A         src/baz.c
A         src/qux.c

   Copy revision 8 of bat.c into your working copy under a different name:
$ svn copy -r 8 bat.c ya-old-bat.c
A         ya-old-bat.c

   Copy an item in your working copy to a URL in the repository (this is
   an immediate commit, so you must supply a commit message):
$ svn copy near.txt file:///var/svn/repos/test/far-away.txt -m "Remote copy."

Committed revision 8.

   Copy an item from the repository to your working copy (this just
   schedules the copyânothing goes into the repository until you commit):
$ svn copy file:///var/svn/repos/test/far-away -r 6 near-here
A         near-here

   [Tip]
   Tip

   This is the recommended way to resurrect a dead file in your
   repository!

   And finally, copy between two URLs:
$ svn copy file:///var/svn/repos/test/far-away \
           file:///var/svn/repos/test/over-there -m "remote copy."

Committed revision 9.

$ svn copy file:///var/svn/repos/test/trunk \
           file:///var/svn/repos/test/tags/0.6.32-prerelease -m "tag tree"

Committed revision 12.

   [Tip]
   Tip

   This is the easiest way to âtagâ a revision in your repositoryâjust svn
   copy that revision (usually HEAD) into your tags directory.

   And don't worry if you forgot to tagâyou can always specify an older
   revision and tag anytime:
$ svn copy -r 11 file:///var/svn/repos/test/trunk \
           file:///var/svn/repos/test/tags/0.6.32-prerelease \
           -m "Forgot to tag at rev 11"

Committed revision 13.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svn delete â Delete an item from a working copy or the repository.

Synopsis

svn delete PATH...
svn delete URL...

Description

   Items specified by PATH are scheduled for deletion upon the next
   commit. Files (and directories that have not been committed) are
   immediately removed from the working copy unless the --keep-local
   option is given. The command will not remove any unversioned or
   modified items; use the --force option to override this behavior.

   Items specified by URL are deleted from the repository via an immediate
   commit. Multiple URLs are committed atomically.

Alternate names

   del, remove, rm

Changes

   Working copy if operating on files; repository if operating on URLs

Accesses repository

   Only if operating on URLs

Options

--editor-cmd CMD
--encoding ENC
--file (-F) FILENAME
--force
--force-log
--keep-local
--message (-m) MESSAGE
--quiet (-q)
--targets FILENAME
--with-revprop ARG

Examples

   Using svn to delete a file from your working copy deletes your local
   copy of the file, but it merely schedules the file to be deleted from
   the repository. When you commit, the file is deleted in the repository.
$ svn delete myfile
D         myfile

$ svn commit -m "Deleted file 'myfile'."
Deleting       myfile
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 14.

   Deleting a URL, however, is immediate, so you have to supply a log
   message:
$ svn delete -m "Deleting file 'yourfile'" \
             file:///var/svn/repos/test/yourfile

Committed revision 15.

   Here's an example of how to force deletion of a file that has local
   mods:
$ svn delete over-there
svn: Attempting restricted operation for modified resource
svn: Use --force to override this restriction
svn: 'over-there' has local modifications

$ svn delete --force over-there
D         over-there

Name

   svn diff â This displays the differences between two revisions or
   paths.

Synopsis

diff [-c M | -r N[:M]] [TARGET[@REV]...]
diff [-r N[:M]] --old=OLD-TGT[@OLDREV] [--new=NEW-TGT[@NEWREV]] [PATH...]
diff OLD-URL[@OLDREV] NEW-URL[@NEWREV]

Description

     * Display the differences between two paths. You can use svn diff in
       the following ways:
     * Use just svn diff to display local modifications in a working copy.
     * Display the changes made to TARGETs as they are seen in REV between
       two revisions. TARGETs may be all working copy paths or all URLs.
       If TARGETs are working copy paths, N defaults to BASE and M to the
       working copy; if TARGETs are URLs, N must be specified and M
       defaults to HEAD. The -c M option is equivalent to -r N:M where N =
       M-1. Using -c -M does the reverse: -r M:N where N = M-1.
     * Display the differences between OLD-TGT as it was seen in OLDREV
       and NEW-TGT as it was seen in NEWREV. PATHs, if given, are relative
       to OLD-TGT and NEW-TGT and restrict the output to differences for
       those paths. OLD-TGT and NEW-TGT may be working copy paths or
       URL[@REV]. NEW-TGT defaults to OLD-TGT if not specified. -r N makes
       OLDREV default to N; -r N:M makes OLDREV default to N and NEWREV
       default to M.

   svn diff OLD-URL[@OLDREV] NEW-URL[@NEWREV] is shorthand for svn diff
   --old=OLD-URL[@OLDREV] --new=NEW-URL[@NEWREV].

   svn diff -r N:M URL is shorthand for svn diff -r N:M --old=URL
   --new=URL.

   svn diff [-r N[:M]] URL1[@N] URL2[@M] is shorthand for svn diff [-r
   N[:M]] --old=URL1 --new=URL2.

   If TARGET is a URL, then revs N and M can be given either via the
   --revision (-r) option or by using the â@â notation as described
   earlier.

   If TARGET is a working copy path, the default behavior (when no
   --revision (-r) option is provided) is to display the differences
   between the base and working copies of TARGET. If a --revision (-r)
   option is specified in this scenario, though, it means:

   --revision N:M
          The server compares TARGET@N and TARGET@M.

   --revision N
          The client compares TARGET@N against the working copy.

   If the alternate syntax is used, the server compares URL1 and URL2 at
   revisions N and M, respectively. If either N or M is omitted, a value
   of HEAD is assumed.

   By default, svn diff ignores the ancestry of files and merely compares
   the contents of the two files being compared. If you use
   --notice-ancestry, the ancestry of the paths in question will be taken
   into consideration when comparing revisions (i.e., if you run svn diff
   on two files with identical contents but different ancestry, you will
   see the entire contents of the file as having been removed and added
   again).

Name

   svn export â Export a clean directory tree.

Synopsis

svn export [-r REV] URL[@PEGREV] [PATH]
svn export [-r REV] PATH1[@PEGREV] [PATH2]

Description

   The first form exports a clean directory tree from the repository
   specified by URLâat revision REV if it is given; otherwise, at HEAD,
   into PATH. If PATH is omitted, the last component of the URL is used
   for the local directory name.

   The second form exports a clean directory tree from the working copy
   specified by PATH1 into PATH2. All local changes will be preserved, but
   files not under version control will not be copied.

Alternate names

   None

Changes

   Local disk

Accesses repository

   Only if exporting from a URL

Options

--depth ARG
--force
--ignore-externals
--native-eol EOL
--quiet (-q)
--revision (-r) REV

Examples

   Export from your working copy (doesn't print every file and directory):
$ svn export a-wc my-export
Export complete.

   Export directly from the repository (prints every file and directory):
$ svn export file:///var/svn/repos my-export
A  my-export/test
A  my-export/quiz
â¦
Exported revision 15.

   When rolling operating-system-specific release packages, it can be
   useful to export a tree that uses a specific EOL character for line
   endings. The --native-eol option will do this, but it affects only
   files that have svn:eol-style = native properties attached to them. For
   example, to export a tree with all CRLF line endings (possibly for a
   Windows .zip file distribution):
$ svn export file:///var/svn/repos my-export --native-eol CRLF
A  my-export/test
A  my-export/quiz
â¦
Exported revision 15.

   You can specify LR, CR, or CRLF as a line-ending type with the
   --native-eol option.

Synopsis

svn import [PATH] URL

Description

   Recursively commit a copy of PATH to URL. If PATH is omitted, â.â is
   assumed. Parent directories are created in the repository as necessary.
   Unversionable items such as device files and pipes are ignored even if
   --force is specified.

--no-auto-props
--no-ignore
--quiet (-q)
--with-revprop ARG

Examples

   This imports the local directory myproj into trunk/misc in your
   repository. The directory trunk/misc need not exist before you import
   into itâsvn import will recursively create directories for you.
$ svn import -m "New import" myproj \
             http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/trunk/misc
Adding         myproj/sample.txt
â¦
Transmitting file data .........
Committed revision 16.

   Be aware that this will not create a directory named myproj in the
   repository. If that's what you want, simply add myproj to the end of
   the URL:
$ svn import -m "New import" myproj \
            http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/trunk/misc/myproj
Adding         myproj/sample.txt
â¦
Transmitting file data .........
Committed revision 16.

   After importing data, note that the original tree is not under version
   control. To start working, you still need to svn checkout a fresh
   working copy of the tree.

Name

   svn list â List directory entries in the repository.

Synopsis

svn list [TARGET[@REV]...]

Description

   List each TARGET file and the contents of each TARGET directory as they
   exist in the repository. If TARGET is a working copy path, the
   corresponding repository URL will be used.

   The default TARGET is â.â, meaning the repository URL of the current
   working copy directory.

   With --verbose (-v), svn list shows the following fields for each item:
     * Revision number of the last commit
     * Author of the last commit
     * If locked, the letter âOâ (see the preceding section on svn info
       for details).
     * Size (in bytes)
     * Date and time of the last commit

   With --xml, output is in XML format (with a header and an enclosing
   document element unless --incremental is also specified). All of the
   information is present; the --verbose (-v) option is not accepted.

Alternate names

   ls

Changes

   Nothing

Accesses repository

   Yes

Options

--depth ARG
--incremental
--recursive (-R)
--revision (-r) REV
--verbose (-v)
--xml

Examples

   svn list is most useful if you want to see what files a repository has
   without downloading a working copy:
$ svn list http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test/support
README.txt
INSTALL
examples/
â¦

   You can pass the --verbose (-v) option for additional information,
   rather like the Unix command ls -l:
$ svn list -v file:///var/svn/repos
     16 sally         28361 Jan 16 23:18 README.txt
     27 sally             0 Jan 18 15:27 INSTALL
     24 harry               Jan 18 11:27 examples/

   You can also get svn list output in XML format with the --xml option:
$ svn list --xml http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<lists>
<list
   path="http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test">

   For further details, see the earlier section the section called âsvn
   listâ.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svn lock â Lock working copy paths or URLs in the repository so that no
   other user can commit changes to them.

Synopsis

svn lock TARGET...

Description

   Lock each TARGET. If any TARGET is already locked by another user,
   print a warning and continue locking the rest of the TARGETs. Use
   --force to steal a lock from another user or working copy.

Alternate names

   None

Changes

   Working copy, repository

Accesses repository

   Yes

Options

--encoding ENC
--file (-F) FILENAME
--force
--force-log
--message (-m) MESSAGE
--targets FILENAME

Examples

   Lock two files in your working copy:
$ svn lock tree.jpg house.jpg
'tree.jpg' locked by user 'harry'.
'house.jpg' locked by user 'harry'.

   Lock a file in your working copy that is currently locked by another
   user:
$ svn lock tree.jpg
svn: warning: Path '/tree.jpg is already locked by user 'sally in \
     filesystem '/var/svn/repos/db'

$ svn lock --force tree.jpg
'tree.jpg' locked by user 'harry'.

   Lock a file without a working copy:
$ svn lock http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test/tree.jpg
'tree.jpg' locked by user 'harry'.

   For further details, see the section called âLockingâ.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svn log â Display commit log messages.

Synopsis

svn log [PATH]
svn log URL[@REV] [PATH...]

Description

   Shows log messages from the repository. If no arguments are supplied,
   svn log shows the log messages for all files and directories inside
   (and including) the current working directory of your working copy. You
   can refine the results by specifying a path, one or more revisions, or
   any combination of the two. The default revision range for a local path
   is BASE:1.

   If you specify a URL alone, it prints log messages for everything the
   URL contains. If you add paths past the URL, only messages for those
   paths under that URL will be printed. The default revision range for a
   URL is HEAD:1.

   With --verbose (-v), svn log will also print all affected paths with
   each log message. With --quiet (-q), svn log will not print the log
   message body itself, this is compatible with --verbose (-v).

   Each log message is printed just once, even if more than one of the
   affected paths for that revision were explicitly requested. Logs follow
   copy history by default. Use --stop-on-copy to disable this behavior,
   which can be useful for determining branch points.

Alternate names

   None

Accesses repository

   Yes

Options

--change (-c) ARG

--revision (-r) REV
--stop-on-copy
--targets FILENAME
--use-merge-history (-g)
--verbose (-v)
--with-all-revprops
--with-revprop ARG
--xml

Examples

   You can see the log messages for all the paths that changed in your
   working copy by running svn log from the top:
$ svn log
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r20 | harry | 2003-01-17 22:56:19 -0600 (Fri, 17 Jan 2003) | 1 line

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r17 | sally | 2003-01-16 23:21:19 -0600 (Thu, 16 Jan 2003) | 2 lines
â¦

   Examine all log messages for a particular file in your working copy:
$ svn log foo.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r32 | sally | 2003-01-13 00:43:13 -0600 (Mon, 13 Jan 2003) | 1 line

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r28 | sally | 2003-01-07 21:48:33 -0600 (Tue, 07 Jan 2003) | 3 lines
â¦

   If you don't have a working copy handy, you can log a URL:
$ svn log http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test/foo.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r32 | sally | 2003-01-13 00:43:13 -0600 (Mon, 13 Jan 2003) | 1 line

Added defines.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r28 | sally | 2003-01-07 21:48:33 -0600 (Tue, 07 Jan 2003) | 3 lines
â¦

   If you want several distinct paths underneath the same URL, you can use
   the URL [PATH...] syntax:
$ svn log http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test/ foo.c bar.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r32 | sally | 2003-01-13 00:43:13 -0600 (Mon, 13 Jan 2003) | 1 line

Added defines.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r31 | harry | 2003-01-10 12:25:08 -0600 (Fri, 10 Jan 2003) | 1 line

Added new file bar.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r28 | sally | 2003-01-07 21:48:33 -0600 (Tue, 07 Jan 2003) | 3 lines
â¦

   The --verbose (-v) option causes svn log to include information about
   the paths that were changed in each displayed revision. These paths
   appear, one path per line of output, with action codes that indicate
   what type of change was made to the path.
$ svn log -v http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test/ foo.c bar.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r32 | sally | 2003-01-13 00:43:13 -0600 (Mon, 13 Jan 2003) | 1 line
Changed paths:
   M /foo.c

Added defines.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r31 | harry | 2003-01-10 12:25:08 -0600 (Fri, 10 Jan 2003) | 1 line
Changed paths:
   A /bar.c

Added new file bar.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r28 | sally | 2003-01-07 21:48:33 -0600 (Tue, 07 Jan 2003) | 3 lines
â¦

   svn log uses just a handful of action codes, and they are similar to
   the ones the svn update command uses:

   A
          The item was added.

   D
          The item was deleted.

   M
          Properties or textual contents on the item were changed.

   R
          The item was replaced by a different one at the same location.

   In addition to the action codes which precede the changed paths, svn
   log with the --verbose (-v) option will note whether a path was added
   or replaced as the result of a copy operation. It does so by printing
   (from COPY-FROM-PATH:COPY-FROM-REV) after such paths.

   When you're concatenating the results of multiple calls to the log
   command, you may want to use the --incremental option. svn log normally
   prints out a dashed line at the beginning of a log message, after each
   subsequent log message, and following the final log message. If you ran
   svn log on a range of two revisions, you would get this:
$ svn log -r 14:15
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r14 | â¦

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r15 | â¦

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   However, if you wanted to gather two nonsequential log messages into a
   file, you might do something like this:
$ svn log -r 14 > mylog
$ svn log -r 19 >> mylog
$ svn log -r 27 >> mylog
$ cat mylog
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r14 | â¦

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r19 | â¦

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r27 | â¦

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   You can avoid the clutter of the double dashed lines in your output by
   using the --incremental option:
$ svn log --incremental -r 14 > mylog
$ svn log --incremental -r 19 >> mylog
$ svn log --incremental -r 27 >> mylog
$ cat mylog
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r14 | â¦

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r19 | â¦

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r27 | â¦

   The --incremental option provides similar output control when using the
   --xml option:
$ svn log --xml --incremental -r 1 sandwich.txt
<logentry
   revision="1">
<author>harry</author>
<date>2008-06-03T06:35:53.048870Z</date>
<msg>Initial Import.</msg>
</logentry>

   [Tip]
   Tip

   Sometimes when you run svn log on a specific path and a specific
   revision, you see no log information output at all, as in the
   following:
$ svn log -r 20 http://svn.red-bean.com/untouched.txt
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   That just means the path wasn't modified in that revision. To get log
   information for that revision, either run the log operation against the
   repository's root URL, or specify a path that you happen to know was
   changed in that revision:
$ svn log -r 20 touched.txt
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r20 | sally | 2003-01-17 22:56:19 -0600 (Fri, 17 Jan 2003) | 1 line

Name

   svn merge â Apply the differences between two sources to a working copy
   path.

Synopsis

svn merge sourceURL1[@N] sourceURL2[@M] [WCPATH]
svn merge sourceWCPATH1@N sourceWCPATH2@M [WCPATH]
svn merge [[-c M]... | [-r N:M]...] [SOURCE[@REV] [WCPATH]]

Description

   In the first form, the source URLs are specified at revisions N and M.
   These are the two sources to be compared. The revisions default to HEAD
   if omitted.

   In the second form, the URLs corresponding to the source working copy
   paths define the sources to be compared. The revisions must be
   specified.

   In the third form, SOURCE can be either a URL or a working copy path
   (in which case its corresponding URL is used). If not specified, SOURCE
   will be the same as WCPATH. SOURCE in revision REV is compared as it
   existed between revisions N and M for each revision range provided. If
   REV is not specified, HEAD is assumed.

   -c M is equivalent to -r <M-1>:M, and -c -M does the reverse: -r
   M:<M-1>. If no revision ranges are specified, the default range of
   1:HEAD is used. Multiple -c and/or -r instances may be specified, and
   mixing of forward and reverse ranges is allowedâthe ranges are
   internally compacted to their minimum representation before merging
   begins (which may result in no-op).

   WCPATH is the working copy path that will receive the changes. If
   WCPATH is omitted, a default value of â.â is assumed, unless the
   sources have identical basenames that match a file within â.â. In this
   case, the differences will be applied to that file.

   Subversion will internally track metadata about the merge operation
   only if the two sources are ancestrally relatedâif the first source is
   an ancestor of the second or vice versa. This is guaranteed to be the
   case when using the third form. Unlike svn diff, the merge command
   takes the ancestry of a file into consideration when performing a merge
   operation. This is very important when you're merging changes from one
   branch into another and you've renamed a file on one branch but not the
   other.

Name

   svn mergeinfo â Query merge-related information. See the section called
   âMergeinfo and Previewsâ for details.

Synopsis

svn mergeinfo SOURCE_URL[@REV] [TARGET[@REV]...]

Description

   Query information related to merges (or potential merges) between
   SOURCE-URL and TARGET. If the --show-revs option is not provided,
   display revisions which have been merged from SOURCE-URL to TARGET.
   Otherwise, display either merged or eligible revisions as specified by
   the --show-revs option.

Alternate names

   None

Examples

   Find out which changesets your have been merged from your trunk
   directory into your test branch:
$ svn pget svn:mergeinfo ^/branches/test
/branches/other:3-4
/trunk:11-13,14,16
$ svn mergeinfo --show-revs merged ^/trunk ^/branches/test
r11
r12
r13
r14
r16
$

   Note that the default output from the svn mergeinfo command is to
   display merged revisions, so the --show-revs option shown in the
   command line of the previous example is not strictly required.

   Find out which changesets from your trunk directory have not yet been
   merged into your test branch:
$ svn mergeinfo --show-revs eligible ^/trunk ^/branches/test
r15
r17
r20
r21

   svn mkdir â Create a new directory under version control.

Synopsis

svn mkdir PATH...
svn mkdir URL...

Description

   Create a directory with a name given by the final component of the PATH
   or URL. A directory specified by a working copy PATH is scheduled for
   addition in the working copy. A directory specified by a URL is created
   in the repository via an immediate commit. Multiple directory URLs are
   committed atomically. In both cases, all the intermediate directories
   must already exist unless the --parents option is used.

Examples

   Create a directory in your working copy:
$ svn mkdir newdir
A         newdir

   Create one in the repository (this is an instant commit, so a log
   message is required):
$ svn mkdir -m "Making a new dir." http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/newdir

Name

   svn move â Move a file or directory.

Synopsis

svn move SRC... DST

Description

   This command moves files or directories in your working copy or in the
   repository.
   [Tip]
   Tip

   This command is equivalent to an svn copy followed by svn delete.

   When moving multiple sources, they will be added as children of DST,
   which must be a directory.

   [Note]
   Note

   Subversion does not support moving between working copies and URLs. In
   addition, you can only move files within a single repositoryâSubversion
   does not support cross-repository moving. Subversion supports the
   following types of moves within a single repository:

   WC â WC
          Move and schedule a file or directory for addition (with
          history).

   URL â URL
          Complete server-side rename.

Alternate names

   mv, rename, ren

Examples

   Move a file in your working copy:
$ svn move foo.c bar.c
A         bar.c
D         foo.c

   Move several files in your working copy into a subdirectory:
$ svn move baz.c bat.c qux.c src
A         src/baz.c
D         baz.c
A         src/bat.c
D         bat.c
A         src/qux.c
D         qux.c

   Move a file in the repository (this is an immediate commit, so it
   requires a commit message):
$ svn move -m "Move a file" http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/foo.c \
                            http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/bar.c

Examples

   You can use proplist to see the properties on an item in your working
   copy:
$ svn proplist foo.c
Properties on 'foo.c':
  svn:mime-type
  svn:keywords
  owner

   But with the --verbose flag, svn proplist is extremely handy as it also
   shows you the values for the properties:
$ svn proplist --verbose foo.c
Properties on 'foo.c':
  svn:mime-type : text/plain
  svn:keywords : Author Date Rev
  owner : sally

Synopsis

svn propset PROPNAME [PROPVAL | -F VALFILE] PATH...
svn propset PROPNAME --revprop -r REV [PROPVAL | -F VALFILE] [TARGET]

Description

   Set PROPNAME to PROPVAL on files, directories, or revisions. The first
   example creates a versioned, local property change in the working copy,
   and the second creates an unversioned, remote property change on a
   repository revision (TARGET determines only which repository to
   access).

Tip

   Subversion has a number of âspecialâ properties that affect its

Examples

   Set the MIME type for a file:
$ svn propset svn:mime-type image/jpeg foo.jpg
property 'svn:mime-type' set on 'foo.jpg'

   On a Unix system, if you want a file to have the executable permission
   set:
$ svn propset svn:executable ON somescript
property 'svn:executable' set on 'somescript'

   Perhaps you have an internal policy to set certain properties for the
   benefit of your coworkers:
$ svn propset owner sally foo.c
property 'owner' set on 'foo.c'

   If you made a mistake in a log message for a particular revision and
   want to change it, use --revprop and set svn:log to the new log
   message:
$ svn propset --revprop -r 25 svn:log "Journaled about trip to New York."
property 'svn:log' set on repository revision '25'

   Or, if you don't have a working copy, you can provide a URL:
$ svn propset --revprop -r 26 svn:log "Document nap." \
              http://svn.red-bean.com/repos
property 'svn:log' set on repository revision '25'

   Lastly, you can tell propset to take its input from a file. You could
   even use this to set the contents of a property to something binary:
$ svn propset owner-pic -F sally.jpg moo.c
property 'owner-pic' set on 'moo.c'

Note

   By default, you cannot modify revision properties in a Subversion
   repository. Your repository administrator must explicitly enable
   revision property modifications by creating a hook named
   pre-revprop-change. See the section called âImplementing Repository
   Hooksâ for more information on hook scripts.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svn resolve â Resolve conflicts on working copy files or directories.

Synopsis

svn resolve PATH...

Description

   Resolve âconflictedâ state on working copy files or directories. This
   routine does not semantically resolve conflict markers; however, it
   replaces PATH with the version specified by the --accept argument and
   then removes conflict-related artifact files. This allows PATH to be
   committed againâthat is, it tells Subversion that the conflicts have
   been âresolved.â. You can pass the following arguments to the --accept
   command depending on your desired resolution:

   base
          Choose the file that was the BASE revision before you updated
          your working copy. That is, the file that you checked out before
          you made your latest edits.

   working
          Assuming that you've manually handled the conflict resolution,
          choose the version of the file as it currently stands in your
          working copy.

   mine-full
          Resolve all conflicted files with copies of the files as they
          stood immediately before you ran svn update.

   theirs-full
          Resolve all conflicted files with copies of the files that were
          fetched from the server when you ran svn update.

   See the section called âResolve Conflicts (Merging Others' Changes)â

        (h) help for more options: p
C    foo.c

Name

   svn resolved â Deprecated. Remove âconflictedâ state on working copy
   files or directories.

Synopsis

svn resolved PATH...

Description

   This command has been deprecated in favor of running svn resolve
   --accept working PATH. See svn resolve in the preceding section for
   details.

   Remove âconflictedâ state on working copy files or directories. This
   routine does not semantically resolve conflict markers; it merely
   removes conflict-related artifact files and allows PATH to be committed
   again; that is, it tells Subversion that the conflicts have been
   âresolved.â See the section called âResolve Conflicts (Merging Others'
   Changes)â for an in-depth look at resolving conflicts.

   No

Options

--depth ARG
--quiet (-q)
--recursive (-R)

Examples

   If you get a conflict on an update, your working copy will sprout three
   new files:
$ svn update
C  foo.c
Updated to revision 31.
$ ls
foo.c
foo.c.mine
foo.c.r30
foo.c.r31

   Once you've resolved the conflict and foo.c is ready to be committed,
   run svn resolved to let your working copy know you've taken care of
   everything.

Warning

   You can just remove the conflict files and commit, but svn resolved
   fixes up some bookkeeping data in the working copy administrative area
   in addition to removing the conflict files, so we recommend that you
   use this command.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svn revert â Undo all local edits.

Synopsis

svn revert PATH...

Description

   Reverts any local changes to a file or directory and resolves any
   conflicted states. svn revert will revert not only the contents of an
   item in your working copy, but also any property changes. Finally, you
   can use it to undo any scheduling operations that you may have
   performed (e.g., files scheduled for addition or deletion can be
   âunscheduledâ).

Alternate names

   None

Changes

   Working copy

Accesses repository

Options

--changelist ARG
--depth ARG
--quiet (-q)

Examples

   Discard changes to a file:
$ svn revert foo.c
Reverted foo.c

   If you want to revert a whole directory of files, use the
   --depth=infinity option:
$ svn revert --depth=infinity .
Reverted newdir/afile
Reverted foo.c
Reverted bar.txt

   Lastly, you can undo any scheduling operations:
$ svn add mistake.txt whoops
A         mistake.txt
A         whoops
A         whoops/oopsie.c

$ svn revert mistake.txt whoops
Reverted mistake.txt
Reverted whoops

$ svn status
?      mistake.txt
?      whoops

Warning

   svn revert is inherently dangerous, since its entire purpose is to
   throw away dataânamely, your uncommitted changes. Once you've reverted,
   Subversion provides no way to get back those uncommitted changes.

   If you provide no targets to svn revert, it will do nothingâto protect
   you from accidentally losing changes in your working copy, svn revert
   requires you to provide at least one target.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svn status â Print the status of working copy files and directories.

Synopsis

svn status [PATH...]

Description

   Print the status of working copy files and directories. With no
   arguments, it prints only locally modified items (no repository
   access). With --show-updates, it adds working revision and server
   out-of-date information. With --verbose, it prints full revision
   information on every item. With --quiet, it prints only summary
   information about locally modified items.

   The first six columns in the output are each one character wide, and
   each column gives you information about different aspects of each
   working copy item.

   The first column indicates that an item was added, deleted, or
   otherwise changed:

   ' '
          No modifications.

   'A'
          Item is scheduled for addition.

   'D'
          Item is scheduled for deletion.

   'M'
          Item has been modified.

   'R'
          Item has been replaced in your working copy. This means the file
          was scheduled for deletion, and then a new file with the same
          name was scheduled for addition in its place.

   'C'
          The contents (as opposed to the properties) of the item conflict
          with updates received from the repository.

   'X'
          Item is present because of an externals definition.

   'I'
          Item is being ignored (e.g., with the svn:ignore property).

   '?'
          Item is not under version control.

   '!'
          Item is missing (e.g., you moved or deleted it without using
          svn). This also indicates that a directory is incomplete (a
          checkout or update was interrupted).

   '~'
          Item is versioned as one kind of object (file, directory, link),
          but has been replaced by a different kind of object.

   The second column tells the status of a file's or directory's
   properties:

   ' '
          No modifications.

   'M'
          Properties for this item have been modified.

   'C'
          Properties for this item are in conflict with property updates
          received from the repository.

   The third column is populated only if the working copy directory is
   locked (see the section called âSometimes You Just Need to Clean Upâ):

   ' '
          Item is not locked.

   'L'
          Item is locked.

   The fourth column is populated only if the item is scheduled for
   addition-with-history:

   ' '
          No history scheduled with commit.

   '+'
          History scheduled with commit.

   The fifth column is populated only if the item is switched relative to
   its parent (see the section called âTraversing Branchesâ):

   ' '
          Item is a child of its parent directory.

   'S'
          Item is switched.

   The sixth column is populated with lock information:

   ' '
          When --show-updates is used, the file is not locked. If
          --show-updates is not used, this merely means that the file is
          not locked in this working copy.

   K
          File is locked in this working copy.

   O
          File is locked either by another user or in another working
          copy. This appears only when --show-updates is used.

   T
          File was locked in this working copy, but the lock has been
          âstolenâ and is invalid. The file is currently locked in the
          repository. This appears only when --show-updates is used.

   B
          File was locked in this working copy, but the lock has been
          âbrokenâ and is invalid. The file is no longer locked. This
          appears only when --show-updates is used.

   The out-of-date information appears in the seventh column (only if you
   pass the --show-updates option):

   ' '
          The item in your working copy is up to date.

   '*'
          A newer revision of the item exists on the server.

   The remaining fields are variable width and delimited by spaces. The
   working revision is the next field if the --show-updates or --verbose
   option is passed.

   If the --verbose option is passed, the last committed revision and last
   committed author are displayed next.

   The working copy path is always the final field, so it can include
   spaces.

Examples

   This is the easiest way to find out what changes you have made to your
   working copy:
$ svn status wc
 M     wc/bar.c
A  +   wc/qax.c

   If you want to find out what files in your working copy are out of
   date, pass the --show-updates option (this will not make any changes to
   your working copy). Here you can see that wc/foo.c has changed in the
   repository since we last updated our working copy:
$ svn status --show-updates wc
 M           965    wc/bar.c
       *     965    wc/foo.c
A  +         965    wc/qax.c
Status against revision:    981

Note

   --show-updates only places an asterisk next to items that are out of
   date (i.e., items that will be updated from the repository if you later
   use svn update). --show-updates does not cause the status listing to
   reflect the repository's version of the item (although you can see the
   revision number in the repository by passing the --verbose option).

   The most information you can get out of the status subcommand is as
   follows:
$ svn status --show-updates --verbose wc
 M           965       938 sally        wc/bar.c
       *     965       922 harry        wc/foo.c
A  +         965       687 harry        wc/qax.c
             965       687 harry        wc/zig.c
Head revision:   981

   Lastly, you can get svn status output in XML format with the --xml
   option:
$ svn status --xml wc
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<status>
<target
   path="wc">
<entry
   path="qax.c">
<wc-status
   props="none"
   item="added"
   revision="0">

</entry>
<entry
   path="bar.c">
<wc-status
   props="normal"
   item="modified"
   revision="965">

</commit>
</wc-status>

   The first variant of this subcommand (without the --relocate option)
   updates your working copy to point to a new URLâusually a URL that
   shares a common ancestor with your working copy, although not
   necessarily. This is the Subversion way to move a working copy to a new
   branch. If specified, PEGREV determines in which revision the target is
   first looked up. See the section called âTraversing Branchesâ for an
   in-depth look at switching.

   If --force is used, unversioned obstructing paths in the working copy
   do not automatically cause a failure if the switch attempts to add the
   same path. If the obstructing path is the same type (file or directory)
   as the corresponding path in the repository, it becomes versioned but
   its contents are left untouched in the working copy. This means that an
   obstructing directory's unversioned children may also obstruct and
   become versioned. For files, any content differences between the
   obstruction and the repository are treated like a local modification to
   the working copy. All properties from the repository are applied to the
   obstructing path.

   As with most subcommands, you can limit the scope of the switch
   operation to a particular tree depth using the --depth option.
   Alternatively, you can use the --set-depth option to set a new âstickyâ
   working copy depth on the switch target. Currently, the depth of a
   working copy directory can only be increased (telescoped more deeply);
   you cannot make a directory more shallow.

   The --relocate option causes svn switch to do something different: it
   updates your working copy to point to the same repository directory,
   only at a different URL (typically because an administrator has moved
   the repository to another server, or to another URL on the same
   server).

Examples

   If you're currently inside the directory vendors, which was branched to
   vendors-with-fix, and you'd like to switch your working copy to that
   branch:
$ svn switch http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/branches/vendors-with-fix .
U  myproj/foo.txt
U  myproj/bar.txt
U  myproj/baz.c
U  myproj/qux.c
Updated to revision 31.

   To switch back, just provide the URL to the location in the repository
   from which you originally checked out your working copy:
$ svn switch http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/trunk/vendors .
U  myproj/foo.txt
U  myproj/bar.txt
U  myproj/baz.c
U  myproj/qux.c
Updated to revision 31.

Tip

   You can switch just part of your working copy to a branch if you don't
   want to switch your entire working copy.

   Sometimes an administrator might change the location (or apparent
   location) of your repositoryâin other words, the content of the
   repository doesn't change, but the repository's root URL does. For
   example, the hostname may change, the URL scheme may change, or any
   part of the URL that leads to the repository itself may change. Rather
   than check out a new working copy, you can have the svn switch command
   ârewriteâ your working copy's administrative metadata to refer to the
   new repository location. If you use the --relocate option to svn
   switch, Subversion will contact the repository to validate the
   relocation request (looking for the repository at the new URL, of
   course), and then do this metadata rewriting. No file contents will be
   changed as the result of this type of switch operationâthis is a
   metadata-only modification to the working copy.
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos test
A  test/a
A  test/b
â¦

$ mv repos newlocation
$ cd test/

$ svn update
svn: Unable to open an ra_local session to URL
svn: Unable to open repository 'file:///var/svn/repos'

$ svn switch --relocate file:///var/svn/repos file:///tmp/newlocation .
$ svn update
At revision 3.

Warning

   Be careful when using the --relocate option. If you mistype the
   argument, you might end up creating nonsensical URLs within your
   working copy that render the whole workspace unusable and tricky to
   fix. It's also important to understand exactly when one should or
   shouldn't use --relocate. Here's the rule of thumb:
     * If the working copy needs to reflect a new directory within the
       repository, use just svn switch.
     * If the working copy still reflects the same repository directory,
       but the location of the repository itself has changed, use svn
       switch with the --relocate option.

Name

   svn unlock â Unlock working copy paths or URLs.

Synopsis

svn unlock TARGET...

Description

   Unlock each TARGET. If any TARGET is locked by another user or no valid
   lock token exists in the working copy, print a warning and continue
   unlocking the rest of the TARGETs. Use --force to break a lock
   belonging to another user or working copy.

'house.jpg' unlocked.

   Unlock a file in your working copy that is currently locked by another
   user:
$ svn unlock tree.jpg
svn: 'tree.jpg' is not locked in this working copy
$ svn unlock --force tree.jpg
'tree.jpg' unlocked.

   Unlock a file without a working copy:
$ svn unlock http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test/tree.jpg
'tree.jpg unlocked.

   For further details, see the section called âLockingâ.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svn update â Update your working copy.

Synopsis

svn update [PATH...]

Description

   svn update brings changes from the repository into your working copy.
   If no revision is given, it brings your working copy up to date with
   the HEAD revision. Otherwise, it synchronizes the working copy to the
   revision given by the --revision option. As part of the
   synchronization, svn update also removes any stale locks (see the
   section called âSometimes You Just Need to Clean Upâ) found in the
   working copy.

   For each updated item, it prints a line that starts with a character
   reporting the action taken. These characters have the following
   meaning:

   A
          Added

   B
          Broken lock (third column only)

   D
          Deleted

   U
          Updated

   C
          Conflicted

   G
          Merged

   E
          Existed

   A character in the first column signifies an update to the actual file,
   whereas updates to the file's properties are shown in the second
   column. Lock information is printed in the third column.

   As with most subcommands, you can limit the scope of the update
   operation to a particular tree depth using the --depth option.
   Alternatively, you can use the --set-depth option to set a new âstickyâ
   working copy depth on the update target. Currently, the depth of a
   working copy directory can only be increased (telescoped more deeply);
   you cannot make a directory more shallow.

Updated to revision 32.

   You can also âupdateâ your working copy to an older revision
   (Subversion doesn't have the concept of âstickyâ files like CVS does;
   see Appendix B, Subversion for CVS Users):
$ svn update -r30
A  newdir/README
D  newdir/toggle.c
D  newdir/disclose.c
D  newdir/launch.c
U  foo.c
Updated to revision 30.

Tip

   If you want to examine an older revision of a single file, you may want
   to use svn cat insteadâit won't change your working copy.

svnadmin

   svnadmin is the administrative tool for monitoring and repairing your
   Subversion repository. For detailed information on repository
   administration, see the maintenance section for the section called
   âsvnadminâ.

   Since svnadmin works via direct repository access (and thus can only be
   used on the machine that holds the repository), it refers to the
   repository with a path, not a URL.

svnadmin Options

   Options in svmadin are global, just as they are in svn:

   --bdb-log-keep
          (Berkeley DB-specific.) Disable automatic log removal of
          database logfiles. Having these logfiles around can be
          convenient if you need to restore from a catastrophic repository
          failure.

   --bdb-txn-nosync
          (Berkeley DB-specific.) Disables fsync when committing database
          transactions. Used with the svnadmin create command to create a
          Berkeley DB-backed repository with DB_TXN_NOSYNC enabled (which
          improves speed but has some risks associated with it).

   --bypass-hooks
          Bypass the repository hook system.

   --clean-logs
          Remove unused Berkeley DB logs.

   --force-uuid
          By default, when loading data into repository that already
          contains revisions, svnadmin will ignore the UUID from the dump
          stream. This option will cause the repository's UUID to be set
          to the UUID from the stream.

   --ignore-uuid
          By default, when loading an empty repository, svnadmin will
          ignore the UUID from the dump stream. This option will force
          that UUID to be ignored (useful for overriding your
          configuration file if it has --force-uuid set).

   --incremental
          Dump a revision only as a diff against the previous revision,
          instead of the usual fulltext.

   --parent-dir DIR
          When loading a dump file, root paths at DIR instead of /.

   --pre-1.4-compatible
          When creating a new repository, use a format that is compatible
          with versions of Subversion earlier than Subversion 1.4.

   --pre-1.5-compatible
          When creating a new repository, use a format that is compatible
          with versions of Subversion earlier than Subversion 1.5.

   --revision (-r) ARG
          Specify a particular revision to operate on.

   --quiet
          Do not show normal progressâshow only errors.

   --use-post-commit-hook
          When loading a dump file, runs the repository's post-commit hook
          after finalizing each newly loaded revision.

   --use-post-revprop-change-hook
          When changing a revision property, runs the repository's
          post-revprop-change hook after changing the revision property.

   --use-pre-commit-hook
          When loading a dump file, runs the repository's pre-commit hook
          before finalizing each newly loaded revision. If the hook fails,
          aborts the commit and terminates the load process.

   --use-pre-revprop-change-hook
          When changing a revision property, runs the repository's
          pre-revprop-change hook before changing the revision property.
          If the hook fails, aborts the modification and terminates.

svnadmin Subcommands

   Here are the various subcommands for the svnadmin program.

Name

   svnadmin crashtest â Simulate a process that crashes.

Synopsis

svnadmin crashtest REPOS_PATH

Description

   Open the repository at REPOS_PATH, then abort, thus simulating a
   process that crashes while holding an open repository handle. This is
   used for testing automatic repository recovery (a new feature in
   Berkeley DB 4.4). It's unlikely that you'll need to run this command.

Options

   None

Examples

$ svnadmin crashtest /var/svn/repos
Aborted

   Exciting, isn't it?
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin create â Create a new, empty repository.

Synopsis

svnadmin create REPOS_PATH

Description

   Create a new, empty repository at the path provided. If the provided
   directory does not exist, it will be created for you. ^[57] As of
   Subversion 1.2, svnadmin creates new repositories with the FSFS
   filesystem backend by default.

   While svnadmin create will create the base directory for a new
   repository, it will not create intermediate directories. For example,
   if you have an empty directory named /var/svn, creating /var/svn/repos
   will work, while attempting to create /var/svn/subdirectory/repos will
   fail with an error.

Options

--bdb-log-keep
--bdb-txn-nosync
--config-dir DIR
--fs-type TYPE
--pre-1.4-compatible
--pre-1.5-compatible

Examples

   Creating a new repository is this easy:
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/repos

   In Subversion 1.0, a Berkeley DB repository is always created. In
   Subversion 1.1, a Berkeley DB repository is the default repository
   type, but an FSFS repository can be created using the --fs-type option:
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/repos --fs-type fsfs
   __________________________________________________________________

   ^[57] Remember, svnadmin works only with local paths, not URLs.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin deltify â Deltify changed paths in a revision range.

Synopsis

svnadmin deltify [-r LOWER[:UPPER]] REPOS_PATH

Description

   svnadmin deltify exists in current versions of Subversion only for
   historical reasons. This command is deprecated and no longer needed.

   It dates from a time when Subversion offered administrators greater
   control over compression strategies in the repository. This turned out
   to be a lot of complexity for very little gain, and this âfeatureâ was
   deprecated.

Options

--quiet (-q)
--revision (-r) REV
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin dump â Dump the contents of the filesystem to stdout.

Synopsis

svnadmin dump REPOS_PATH [-r LOWER[:UPPER]] [--incremental]

Description

   Dump the contents of the filesystem to stdout in a âdump fileâ portable
   format, sending feedback to stderr. Dump revisions LOWER rev through
   UPPER rev. If no revisions are given, dump all revision trees. If only
   LOWER is given, dump that one revision tree. See the section called
   âMigrating Repository Data Elsewhereâ for a practical use.

   By default, the Subversion dump stream contains a single revision (the
   first revision in the requested revision range) in which every file and
   directory in the repository in that revision is presented as though
   that whole tree was added at once, followed by other revisions (the
   remainder of the revisions in the requested range), which contain only
   the files and directories that were modified in those revisions. For a
   modified file, the complete full-text representation of its contents,
   as well as all of its properties, are presented in the dump file; for a
   directory, all of its properties are presented.

   Two useful options modify the dump file generator's behavior. The first
   is the --incremental option, which simply causes that first revision in
   the dump stream to contain only the files and directories modified in
   that revision, instead of being presented as the addition of a new
   tree, and in exactly the same way that every other revision in the dump
   file is presented. This is useful for generating a relatively small
   dump file to be loaded into another repository that already has the
   files and directories that exist in the original repository.

   The second useful option is --deltas. This option causes svnadmin dump
   to, instead of emitting full-text representations of file contents and
   property lists, emit only deltas of those items against their previous
   versions. This reduces (in some cases, drastically) the size of the
   dump file that svnadmin dump creates. There are, however, disadvantages
   to using this optionâdeltified dump files are more CPU-intensive to
   create, cannot be operated on by svndumpfilter, and tend not to
   compress as well as their nondeltified counterparts when using
   third-party tools such as gzip and bzip2.

Options

--deltas
--incremental
--quiet (-q)
--revision (-r) REV

Examples

   Dump your whole repository:
$ svnadmin dump /var/svn/repos > full.dump
* Dumped revision 0.
* Dumped revision 1.
* Dumped revision 2.
â¦

   Incrementally dump a single transaction from your repository:
$ svnadmin dump /var/svn/repos -r 21 --incremental > incr.dump
* Dumped revision 21.

   neither a Net connection nor a copy of this book.

Alternate names

     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin hotcopy â Make a hot copy of a repository.

Synopsis

svnadmin hotcopy REPOS_PATH NEW_REPOS_PATH

Description

   This subcommand makes a full âhotâ backup of your repository, including
   all hooks, configuration files, and, of course, database files. If you
   pass the --clean-logs option, svnadmin will perform a hot copy of your
   repository, and then remove unused Berkeley DB logs from the original
   repository. You can run this command at any time and make a safe copy
   of the repository, regardless of whether other processes are using the
   repository.

Options

--clean-logs

Warning

   As described in the section called âBerkeley DBâ, hot-copied Berkeley
   DB repositories are not portable across operating systems, nor will
   they work on machines with a different âendiannessâ than the machine
   where they were created.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin list-dblogs â Ask Berkeley DB which logfiles exist for a given
   Subversion repository (applies only to repositories using the bdb
   backend).

Synopsis

svnadmin list-dblogs REPOS_PATH

Description

   Berkeley DB creates logs of all changes to the repository, which allow
   it to recover in the face of catastrophe. Unless you enable
   DB_LOG_AUTOREMOVE, the logfiles accumulate, although most are no longer
   used and can be deleted to reclaim disk space. See the section called
   âManaging Disk Spaceâ for more information.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin list-unused-dblogs â Ask Berkeley DB which logfiles can be
   safely deleted (applies only to repositories using the bdb backend).

Synopsis

svnadmin list-unused-dblogs REPOS_PATH

Description

   Berkeley DB creates logs of all changes to the repository, which allow
   it to recover in the face of catastrophe. Unless you enable
   DB_LOG_AUTOREMOVE, the logfiles accumulate, although most are no longer
   used and can be deleted to reclaim disk space. See the section called
   âManaging Disk Spaceâ for more information.

Examples

   Remove all unused logfiles from the repository:
$ svnadmin list-unused-dblogs /var/svn/repos
/var/svn/repos/log.0000000031
/var/svn/repos/log.0000000032
/var/svn/repos/log.0000000033

$ svnadmin list-unused-dblogs /var/svn/repos | xargs rm
## disk space reclaimed!
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin load â Read a repository dump stream from stdin.

Synopsis

svnadmin load REPOS_PATH

Description

   Read a repository dump stream from stdin, committing new revisions into
   the repository's filesystem. Send progress feedback to stdout.

Options

--force-uuid
--ignore-uuid
--parent-dir
--quiet (-q)
--use-post-commit-hook
--use-pre-commit-hook

Examples

   This shows the beginning of loading a repository from a backup file
   (made, of course, with svnadmin dump):
$ svnadmin load /var/svn/restored < repos-backup
<<< Started new txn, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : test ... done.
     * adding path : test/a ... done.
â¦

   Or if you want to load into a subdirectory:
$ svnadmin load --parent-dir new/subdir/for/project \
                /var/svn/restored < repos-backup
<<< Started new txn, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : test ... done.
     * adding path : test/a ... done.

Name

   svnadmin lslocks â Print descriptions of all locks.

Synopsis

svnadmin lslocks REPOS_PATH [PATH-IN-REPOS]

Description

   Print descriptions of all locks in repository REPOS_PATH underneath the
   path PATH-IN-REPOS. If PATH-IN-REPOS is not provided, it defaults to
   the root directory of the repository.

Options

   None

Examples

   This lists the one locked file in the repository at /var/svn/repos:

Name

   svnadmin lstxns â Print the names of all uncommitted transactions.

Synopsis

svnadmin lstxns REPOS_PATH

Description

   Print the names of all uncommitted transactions. See the section called
   âRemoving dead transactionsâ for information on how uncommitted
   transactions are created and what you should do with them.

Examples

   List all outstanding transactions in a repository:
$ svnadmin lstxns /var/svn/repos/
1w

     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin recover â Bring a repository database back into a consistent
   state (applies only to repositories using the bdb backend). In
   addition, if repos/conf/passwd does not exist, it will create a default
   passwordfile .

Synopsis

svnadmin recover REPOS_PATH

Description

   Run this command if you get an error indicating that your repository
   needs to be recovered.

Options

--wait

Examples

   Recover a hung repository:
$ svnadmin recover /var/svn/repos/
Repository lock acquired.
Please wait; recovering the repository may take some time...

Recovery completed.
The latest repos revision is 34.

   Recovering the database requires an exclusive lock on the repository.
   (This is a âdatabase lockâ; see the sidebar The Three Meanings of
   âLockâ.) If another process is accessing the repository, then svnadmin
   recover will error:
$ svnadmin recover /var/svn/repos
svn: Failed to get exclusive repository access; perhaps another process
such as httpd, svnserve or svn has it open?

$

   The --wait option, however, will cause svnadmin recover to wait
   indefinitely for other processes to disconnect:
$ svnadmin recover /var/svn/repos --wait
Waiting on repository lock; perhaps another process has it open?

### time goes byâ¦

Repository lock acquired.
Please wait; recovering the repository may take some time...

Recovery completed.
The latest repos revision is 34.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin rmlocks â Unconditionally remove one or more locks from a
   repository.

Synopsis

svnadmin rmlocks REPOS_PATH LOCKED_PATH...

Description

   Remove one or more locks from each LOCKED_PATH.

Options

   None

Examples

   This deletes the locks on tree.jpg and house.jpg in the repository at
   /var/svn/repos:
$ svnadmin rmlocks /var/svn/repos tree.jpg house.jpg
Removed lock on '/tree.jpg.
Removed lock on '/house.jpg.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin rmtxns â Delete transactions from a repository.

Synopsis

svnadmin rmtxns REPOS_PATH TXN_NAME...

Description

   Delete outstanding transactions from a repository. This is covered in
   detail in the section called âRemoving dead transactionsâ.

Options

--quiet (-q)

Examples

   Remove named transactions:
$ svnadmin rmtxns /var/svn/repos/ 1w 1x

   Fortunately, the output of lstxns works great as the input for rmtxns:
$ svnadmin rmtxns /var/svn/repos/  `svnadmin lstxns /var/svn/repos/`

   This removes all uncommitted transactions from your repository.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin setlog â Set the log message on a revision.

Synopsis

svnadmin setlog REPOS_PATH -r REVISION FILE

Description

   Set the log message on revision REVISION to the contents of FILE.

   This is similar to using svn propset with the --revprop option to set
   the svn:log property on a revision, except that you can also use the
   option --bypass-hooks to avoid running any pre- or post-commit hooks,
   which is useful if the modification of revision properties has not been
   enabled in the pre-revprop-change hook.

Warning

   Revision properties are not under version control, so this command will
   permanently overwrite the previous log message.

Options

--bypass-hooks
--revision (-r) REV

Examples

   Set the log message for revision 19 to the contents of the file msg:
$ svnadmin setlog /var/svn/repos/ -r 19 msg
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin setrevprop â Set a property on a revision.

Synopsis

svnadmin setrevprop REPOS_PATH -r REVISION NAME FILE

Description

   Set the property NAME on revision REVISION to the contents of FILE. Use
   --use-pre-revprop-change-hook or --use-post-revprop-change-hook to
   trigger the revision property-related hooks (e.g., if you want an email
   notification sent from your post-revprop-change-hook).

Options

--revision (-r) ARG
--use-post-revprop-change-hook
--use-pre-revprop-change-hook

Examples

   The following sets the revision property repository-photo to the
   contents of the file sandwich.png:
$svnadmin setrevprop /var/svn/repos -r 0 repository-photo sandwich.png

   As you can see, svnadmin setrevprop has no output upon success.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin setuuid â Reset the repository UUID.

Synopsis

svnadmin setuuid REPOS_PATH [NEW_UUID]

Description

   Reset the repository UUID for the repository located at REPOS_PATH. If
   NEW_UUID is provided, use that as the new repository UUID; otherwise,
   generate a brand-new UUID for the repository.

Options

   None

Examples

   If you've svnsynced /var/svn/repos to /var/svn/repos-new and intend to
   use repos-new as your canonical repository, you may want to change the
   UUID for repos-new to the UUID of repos so that your users don't have
   to check out a new working copy to accommodate the change:
$ svnadmin setuuid /var/svn/repos-new 2109a8dd-854f-0410-ad31-d604008985ab

   As you can see, svnadmin setuuid has no output upon success.

Name

   svnadmin upgrade â Upgrade a repository to the latest supported schema
   version.

Synopsis

svnadmin upgrade REPOS_PATH

Description

   Upgrade the repository located at REPOS_PATH to the latest supported
   schema version.

   This functionality is provided as a convenience for repository
   administrators who wish to make use of new Subversion functionality
   without having to undertake a potentially costly full repository dump
   and load operation. As such, the upgrade performs only the minimum
   amount of work needed to accomplish this while still maintaining the
   integrity of the repository. While a dump and subsequent load guarantee
   the most optimized repository state, svnadmin upgrade does not.

Warning

   You should always back up your repository before upgrading.

Options

   None

Examples

   Upgrade the repository at path /var/repos/svn:
$ svnadmin upgrade /var/repos/svn
Repository lock acquired.
Please wait; upgrading the repository may take some time...

Upgrade completed.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnadmin verify â Verify the data stored in the repository.

Synopsis

svnadmin verify REPOS_PATH

Description

   Run this command if you wish to verify the integrity of your
   repository. This basically iterates through all revisions in the
   repository by internally dumping all revisions and discarding the
   outputâit's a good idea to run this on a regular basis to guard against
   latent hard disk failures and âbitrot.â If this command failsâwhich it
   will do at the first sign of a problemâthat means your repository has
   at least one corrupted revision, and you should restore the corrupted
   revision from a backup (you did make a backup, didn't you?).

Options

--quiet (-q)
--revision (-r) ARG

Examples

   Verify a hung repository:
$ svnadmin verify /var/svn/repos/
* Verified revision 1729.

svnlook

   svnlook is a command-line utility for examining different aspects of a
   Subversion repository. It does not make any changes to the
   repositoryâit's just used for âpeeking.â svnlook is typically used by
   the repository hooks, but a repository administrator might find it
   useful for diagnostic purposes.

   Since svnlook works via direct repository access (and thus can be used
   only on the machine that holds the repository), it refers to the
   repository with a path, not a URL.

   If no revision or transaction is specified, svnlook defaults to the
   youngest (most recent) revision of the repository.

svnlook Options

   Options in svnlook are global, just as they are in svn and svnadmin;
   however, most options apply to only one subcommand since the
   functionality of svnlook is (intentionally) limited in scope:

   --copy-info
          Causes svnlook changed to show detailed copy source information.

   --no-diff-deleted
          Prevents svnlook diff from printing differences for deleted
          files. The default behavior when a file is deleted in a
          transaction/revision is to print the same differences that you
          would see if you had left the file but removed all the content.

   --no-diff-added
          Prevents svnlook diff from printing differences for added files.
          The default behavior when you add a file is to print the same
          differences that you would see if you had added the entire
          contents of an existing (empty) file.

   --revision (-r)
          Specifies a particular revision number that you wish to examine.

   --revprop
          Operates on a revision property instead of a property specific
          to a file or directory. This option requires that you also pass
          a revision with the --revision (-r) option.

   --transaction (-t)
          Specifies a particular transaction ID that you wish to examine.

   --show-ids
          Shows the filesystem node revision IDs for each path in the
          filesystem tree.

svnlook Subcommands

   Here are the various subcommands for the svnlook program.

Name

   svnlook author â Print the author.

Synopsis

svnlook author REPOS_PATH

Description

   Print the author of a revision or transaction in the repository.

Options

--revision (-r) REV
--transaction (-t) TXN

Examples

   svnlook author is handy, but not very exciting:
$ svnlook author -r 40 /var/svn/repos
sally
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnlook cat â Print the contents of a file.

Synopsis

svnlook cat REPOS_PATH PATH_IN_REPOS

Description

   Print the contents of a file.

Options

--revision (-r) REV

Examples

   This shows the contents of a file in transaction ax8, located at
   /trunk/README:
$ svnlook cat -t ax8 /var/svn/repos /trunk/README

Name

   svnlook changed â Print the paths that were changed.

Synopsis

svnlook changed REPOS_PATH

Description

   Print the paths that were changed in a particular revision or
   transaction, as well as âsvn update-styleâ status letters in the first
   two columns:

   'A '
          Item added to repository

   'D '
          Item deleted from repository

   'U '
          File contents changed

   '_U'
          Properties of item changed; note the leading underscore

   'UU'
          File contents and properties changed

   Files and directories can be distinguished, as directory paths are
   displayed with a trailing â/â character.

Options

--copy-info
--revision (-r) REV
--transaction (-t) TXN

Examples

   This shows a list of all the changed files and directories in revision
   39 of a test repository. Note that the first changed item is a
   directory, as evidenced by the trailing /:
$ svnlook changed -r 39 /var/svn/repos
A   trunk/vendors/deli/
A   trunk/vendors/deli/chips.txt
A   trunk/vendors/deli/sandwich.txt
A   trunk/vendors/deli/pickle.txt
U   trunk/vendors/baker/bagel.txt
_U  trunk/vendors/baker/croissant.txt
UU  trunk/vendors/baker/pretzel.txt
D   trunk/vendors/baker/baguette.txt

   Here's an example that shows a revision in which a file was renamed:
$ svnlook changed -r 64 /var/svn/repos
A   trunk/vendors/baker/toast.txt
D   trunk/vendors/baker/bread.txt

   Unfortunately, nothing in the preceding output reveals the connection
   between the deleted and added files. Use the --copy-info option to make
   this relationship more apparent:
$ svnlook changed -r 64 --copy-info /var/svn/repos
A + trunk/vendors/baker/toast.txt
    (from trunk/vendors/baker/bread.txt:r63)
D   trunk/vendors/baker/bread.txt

svnsync

   svnsync is the Subversion remote repository mirroring tool. Put simply,
   it allows you to replay the revisions of one repository into another
   one.

   In any mirroring scenario, there are two repositories: the source
   repository, and the mirror (or âsinkâ) repository. The source
   repository is the repository from which svnsync pulls revisions. The
   mirror repository is the destination for the revisions pulled from the
   source repository. Each of the repositories may be local or remoteâthey
   are only ever addressed by their URLs.

   The svnsync process requires only read access to the source repository;
   it never attempts to modify it. But obviously, svnsync requires both
   read and write access to the mirror repository.

Warning

   svnsync is very sensitive to changes made in the mirror repository that
   weren't made as part of a mirroring operation. To prevent this from
   happening, it's best if the svnsync process is the only process
   permitted to modify the mirror repository.

svnsync Options

   Options in svnsync are global, just as they are in svn and svnadmin:

   --config-dir DIR
          Instructs Subversion to read configuration information from the
          specified directory instead of the default location (.subversion
          in the user's home directory).

   --no-auth-cache
          Prevents caching of authentication information (e.g., username
          and password) in the Subversion runtime configuration
          directories.

   --non-interactive
          In the case of an authentication failure or insufficient
          credentials, prevents prompting for credentials (e.g., username
          or password). This is useful if you're running Subversion inside
          an automated script and it's more appropriate to have Subversion
          fail than to prompt for more information.

   --quiet (-q)
          Requests that the client print only essential information while
          performing an operation.

   --source-password PASSWD
          Specifies the password for the Subversion server from which you
          are syncing. If not provided, or if incorrect, Subversion will
          prompt you for this information as needed.

   --source-username NAME
          Specifies the username for the Subversion server from which you
          are syncing. If not provided, or if incorrect, Subversion will
          prompt you for this information as needed.

   --sync-password PASSWD
          Specifies the password for the Subversion server to which you
          are syncing. If not provided, or if incorrect, Subversion will
          prompt you for this information as needed.

   --sync-username NAME
          Specifies the username for the Subversion server to which you
          are syncing. If not provided, or if incorrect, Subversion will
          prompt you for this information as needed.

svnsync Subcommands

   Here are the various subcommands for the svnsync program.

Name

   svnsync copy-revprops â Copy all revision properties for a particular
   revision (or range of revisions) from the source repository to the
   mirror repository.

Synopsis

svnsync copy-revprops DEST_URL [REV[:REV2]

Description

   Because Subversion revision properties can be changed at any time, it's
   possible that the properties for some revision might be changed after
   that revision has already been synchronized to another repository.
   Because the svnsync synchronize command operates only on the range of
   revisions that have not yet been synchronized, it won't notice a
   revision property change outside that range. Left as is, this causes a
   deviation in the values of that revision's properties between the
   source and mirror repositories. svnsync copy-revprops is the answer to
   this problem. Use it to resynchronize the revision properties for a
   particular revision or range of revisions.

Alternate name

   None

Options

--config-dir DIR
--no-auth-cache
--non-interactive
--quiet (-q)
--source-password ARG
--source-username ARG
--sync-password ARG
--sync-username ARG

Examples

   Resynchronize revision properties for a single revision:
$ svnsync copy-revprops file:///var/svn/repos-mirror 6
Copied properties for revision 6.
$
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnsync help â Help!

Synopsis

svnsync help

Description

   This subcommand is useful when you're trapped in a foreign prison with
   neither a Net connection nor a copy of this book, but you do have a
   local Wi-Fi network running and you'd like to sync a copy of your
   repository over to the backup server that Ira The Knife is running over
   in cell block D.

Alternate name

   None

Options

   None
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnsync initialize â Initialize a mirror repository for synchronization
   from the source repository.

Synopsis

svnsync initialize MIRROR_URL SOURCE_URL

Description

   svnsync initialize verifies that a repository meets the requirements of
   a new mirror repositoryâthat it has no previous existing version
   history and that it allows revision property modificationsâand records
   the initial administrative information that associates the mirror
   repository with the source repository. This is the first svnsync
   operation you run on a would-be mirror repository.

Alternate name

   init

Options

--config-dir DIR
--no-auth-cache
--non-interactive
--quiet (-q)
--source-password ARG
--source-username ARG
--sync-password ARG
--sync-username ARG

Examples

   Fail to initialize a mirror repository due to inability to modify
   revision properties:
$ svnsync initialize file:///var/svn/repos-mirror http://svn.example.com/repos
svnsync: Repository has not been enabled to accept revision propchanges;
ask the administrator to create a pre-revprop-change hook
$

   Initialize a repository as a mirror, having already created a
   pre-revprop-change hook that permits all revision property changes:
$ svnsync initialize file:///var/svn/repos-mirror http://svn.example.com/repos
Copied properties for revision 0.
$
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svnsync synchronize â Transfer all pending revisions from the source
   repository to the mirror repository.

Synopsis

svnsync synchronize DEST_URL

Description

   The svnsync synchronize command does all the heavy lifting of a
   repository mirroring operation. After consulting with the mirror
   repository to see which revisions have already been copied into it, it
   then begins to copy any not-yet-mirrored revisions from the source
   repository.

   svnsync synchronize can be gracefully canceled and restarted.

   As of Subversion 1.5, you can limit svnsync to a subdirectory of the
   source repository by specifying the subdirectory as part of the
   SOURCE_URL.

Alternate name

   sync

Options

--config-dir DIR
--no-auth-cache
--non-interactive
--quiet (-q)
--source-password ARG
--source-username ARG
--sync-password ARG
--sync-username ARG

Examples

   Copy unsynchronized revisions from the source repository to the mirror
   repository:
$ svnsync synchronize file:///var/svn/repos-mirror
Committed revision 1.
Copied properties for revision 1.
Committed revision 2.
Copied properties for revision 2.
Committed revision 3.
Copied properties for revision 3.
â¦
Committed revision 45.
Copied properties for revision 45.
Committed revision 46.
Copied properties for revision 46.
Committed revision 47.
Copied properties for revision 47.
$

svnserve

   svnserve allows access to Subversion repositories using Subversion's
   custom network protocol.

   You can run svnserve as a standalone server process (for clients that
   are using the svn:// access method); you can have a daemon such as
   inetd or xinetd launch it for you on demand (also for svn://), or you
   can have sshd launch it on demand for the svn+ssh:// access method.

   Regardless of the access method, once the client has selected a
   repository by transmitting its URL, svnserve reads a file named
   conf/svnserve.conf in the repository directory to determine
   repository-specific settings such as what authentication database to
   use and what authorization policies to apply. See the section called
   âsvnserve, a Custom Serverâ for details of the svnserve.conf file.

svnserve Options

   Unlike the previous commands we've described, svnserve has no
   subcommandsâit is controlled exclusively by options.

   --daemon (-d)
          Causes svnserve to run in daemon mode. svnserve backgrounds
          itself and accepts and serves TCP/IP connections on the svn port
          (3690, by default).

   --foreground
          When used together with -d, causes svnserve to stay in the
          foreground. This is mainly useful for debugging.

   --inetd (-i)
          Causes svnserve to use the stdin and stdout file descriptors, as
          is appropriate for a daemon running out of inetd.

   --help (-h)
          Displays a usage summary and exits.

   --listen-host=HOST
          Causes svnserve to listen on the interface specified by HOST,
          which may be either a hostname or an IP address.

   --listen-once (-X)
          Causes svnserve to accept one connection on the svn port, serve
          it, and exit. This option is mainly useful for debugging.

   --listen-port=PORT
          Causes svnserve to listen on PORT when run in daemon mode.
          (FreeBSD daemons listen only on tcp6 by defaultâthis option
          tells them to also listen on tcp4.)

   --pid-file FILENAME
          Causes svnserve to write its process ID to FILENAME, which must
          be writable by the user under which svnserve is running.

   --root=ROOT (-r=ROOT)
          Sets the virtual root for repositories served by svnserve. The
          pathname in URLs provided by the client will be interpreted
          relative to this root and will not be allowed to escape this
          root.

   --threads (-T)
          When running in daemon mode, causes svnserve to spawn a thread
          instead of a process for each connection (e.g., for when running
          on Windows). The svnserve process still backgrounds itself at
          startup time.

   --tunnel (-t)
          Causes svnserve to run in tunnel mode, which is just like the
          inetd mode of operation (both modes serve one connection over
          stdin/stdout, and then exit), except that the connection is
          considered to be preauthenticated with the username of the
          current UID. This flag is automatically passed for you by the
          client when running over a tunnel agent such as ssh. That means
          there's rarely any need for you to pass this option to svnserve.
          So, if you find yourself typing svnserve --tunnel on the command
          line and wondering what to do next, see the section called
          âTunneling over SSHâ.

   --tunnel-user NAME
          Used in conjunction with the --tunnel option, tells svnserve to
          assume that NAME is the authenticated user, rather than the UID
          of the svnserve process. This is useful for users wishing to
          share a single system account over SSH, but to maintain separate
          commit identities.

   --version
          Displays version information and a list of repository backend
          modules available, and then exits.

svndumpfilter

   svndumpfilter is a command-line utility for removing history from a
   Subversion dump file by either excluding or including paths beginning
   with one or more named prefixes. For details, see the section called
   âsvndumpfilterâ.

svndumpfilter Options

   Options in svndumpfilter are global, just as they are in svn and
   svnadmin:

   --drop-empty-revs
          If filtering causes any revision to be empty (i.e., causes no
          change to the repository), removes these revisions from the
          final dump file.

   --renumber-revs
          Renumbers revisions that remain after filtering.

   --skip-missing-merge-sources
          Skips merge sources that have been removed as part of the
          filtering. Without this option, svndumpfilter will exit with an
          error if the merge source for a retained path is removed by
          filtering.

   --preserve-revprops
          If all nodes in a revision are removed by filtering and
          --drop-empty-revs is not passed, the default behavior of
          svndumpfilter is to remove all revision properties except for
          the date and the log message (which will merely indicate that
          the revision is empty). Passing this option will preserve
          existing revision properties (which may or may not make sense
          since the related content is no longer present in the dump
          file).

   --quiet
          Does not display filtering statistics.

svndumpfilter Subcommands

   Here are the various subcommands for the svndumpfilter program.

Name

   svndumpfilter exclude â Filter out nodes with given prefixes from the
   dump stream.

Synopsis

svndumpfilter exclude PATH_PREFIX...

Description

   This can be used to exclude nodes that begin with one or more
   PATH_PREFIXes from a filtered dump file.

Options

--drop-empty-revs
--preserve-revprops
--quiet
--renumber-revs
--skip-missing-merge-sources

Examples

   If we have a dump file from a repository with a number of different
   picnic-related directories in it, but we want to keep everything except
   the sandwiches part of the repository, we'll exclude only that path:
$ svndumpfilter exclude sandwiches < dumpfile > filtered-dumpfile
Excluding prefixes:
   '/sandwiches'

Revision 0 committed as 0.
Revision 1 committed as 1.
Revision 2 committed as 2.
Revision 3 committed as 3.
Revision 4 committed as 4.

Dropped 1 node(s):
   '/sandwiches'
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svndumpfilter include â Filter out nodes without given prefixes from
   dump stream.

Synopsis

svndumpfilter include PATH_PREFIX...

Description

   Can be used to include nodes that begin with one or more PATH_PREFIXes
   in a filtered dump file (thus excluding all other paths).

Options

--drop-empty-revs
--preserve-revprops
--quiet
--renumber-revs
--skip-missing-merge-sources

Example

   If we have a dump file from a repository with a number of different
   picnic-related directories in it, but want to keep only the sandwiches
   part of the repository, we'll include only that path:
$ svndumpfilter include sandwiches < dumpfile > filtered-dumpfile
Including prefixes:
   '/sandwiches'

Revision 0 committed as 0.
Revision 1 committed as 1.
Revision 2 committed as 2.
Revision 3 committed as 3.

   '/snacks'
   '/supplies'
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   svndumpfilter help â Help!.

Synopsis

svndumpfilter help [SUBCOMMAND...]

Description

   Displays the help message for svndumpfilter. Unlike other help commands
   documented in this chapter, there is no witty commentary for this help
   command. The authors of this book deeply regret the omission.

Options

   None

svnversion

Name

   svnversion â Summarize the local revision(s) of a working copy.

Synopsis

svnversion [OPTIONS] [WC_PATH [TRAIL_URL]]

Description

   svnversion is a program for summarizing the revision mixture of a
   working copy. The resultant revision number, or revision range, is
   written to standard output.

   It's common to use this output in your build process when defining the
   version number of your program.

   TRAIL_URL, if present, is the trailing portion of the URL used to
   determine whether WC_PATH itself is switched (detection of switches
   within WC_PATH does not rely on TRAIL_URL).

   When WC_PATH is not defined, the current directory will be used as the
   working copy path. TRAIL_URL cannot be defined if WC_PATH is not
   explicitly given.

Options

   Like svnserve, svnversion has no subcommandsâonly options:

   --no-newline (-n)
          Omits the usual trailing newline from the output.

   --committed (-c)
          Uses the last-changed revisions rather than the current (i.e.,
          highest locally available) revisions.

   --help (-h)
          Prints a help summary.

   --version
          Prints the version of svnversion and exit with no error.

Examples

   If the working copy is all at the same revision (e.g., immediately
   after an update), then that revision is printed out:
$ svnversion
4168

   You can add TRAIL_URL to make sure the working copy is not switched
   from what you expect. Note that the WC_PATH is required in this
   command:
$ svnversion . /var/svn/trunk
4168

   For a mixed-revision working copy, the range of revisions present is
   printed:
$ svnversion
4123:4168

   If the working copy contains modifications, a trailing "M" is added:
$ svnversion
4168M

   If the working copy is switched, a trailing "S" is added:
$ svnversion
4168S

   Thus, here is a mixed-revision, switched working copy containing some
   local modifications:
$ svnversion
4212:4168MS

   If invoked on a directory that is not a working copy, svnversion
   assumes it is an exported working copy and prints "exported":
$ svnversion
exported

mod_dav_svn

Name

   mod_dav_svn Configuration Directives â Apache configuration directives
   for serving Subversion repositories through the Apache HTTP Server.

Description

   This section briefly describes each Subversion Apache configuration
   directive. For an in-depth description of configuring Apache with
   Subversion, see the section called âhttpd, the Apache HTTP Serverâ.)

Directives

   These are the httpd.conf directives that apply to mod_dav_svn:

   DAV svn
          Must be included in any Directory or Location block for a
          Subversion repository. It tells httpd to use the Subversion
          backend for mod_dav to handle all requests.

   SVNAllowBulkUpdates On|Off
          Toggles support for all-inclusive responses to update-style
          REPORT requests. Subversion clients use REPORT requests to get
          information about directory tree checkouts and updates from
          mod_dav_svn. They can ask the server to send that information in
          one of two ways: with the entirety of the tree's information in
          one massive response, or with a skelta (a skeletal
          representation of a tree delta) which contains just enough
          information for the client to know what additional data to
          request from the server. When this directive is included with a
          value of Off, mod_dav_svn will only ever respond to these REPORT
          requests with skelta responses, regardless of the type of
          responses requested by the client.

          Most folks won't need to use this directive at all. It primarily
          exists for administrators who wishâfor security or auditing
          reasonsâto force Subversion clients to fetch individually all
          the files and directories needed for updates and checkouts, thus
          leaving an audit trail of GET and PROPFIND requests in Apache's
          logs. The default value of this directive is On.

   SVNAutoversioning On|Off
          When its value is On, allows write requests from WebDAV clients
          to result in automatic commits. A generic log message is
          auto-generated and attached to each revision. If you enable
          autoversioning, you'll likely want to set ModMimeUsePathInfo On
          so that mod_mime can set svn:mime-type to the correct MIME type
          automatically (as best as mod_mime is able to, of course). For
          more information, see Appendix C, WebDAV and Autoversioning. The
          default value of this directive is Off.

   SVNPath directory-path
          Specifies the location in the filesystem for a Subversion
          repository's files. In a configuration block for a Subversion
          repository, either this directive or SVNParentPath must be
          present, but not both.

   SVNSpecialURI component
          Specifies the URI component (namespace) for special Subversion
          resources. The default is !svn, and most administrators will
          never use this directive. Set this only if there is a pressing
          need to have a file named !svn in your repository. If you change
          this on a server already in use, it will break all of the
          outstanding working copies, and your users will hunt you down
          with pitchforks and flaming torches.

   SVNReposName name
          Specifies the name of a Subversion repository for use in HTTP
          GET responses. This value will be prepended to the title of all
          directory listings (which are served when you navigate to a
          Subversion repository with a web browser). This directive is
          optional.

   SVNIndexXSLT directory-path
          Specifies the URI of an XSL transformation for directory
          indexes. This directive is optional.

   SVNParentPath directory-path
          Specifies the location in the filesystem of a parent directory
          whose child directories are Subversion repositories. In a
          configuration block for a Subversion repository, either this
          directive or SVNPath must be present, but not both.

   SVNPathAuthz On|Off|short_circuit
          Controls path-based authorization by enabling subrequests (On),
          disabling subrequests (Off; see the section called âDisabling
          path-based checksâ), or querying mod_authz_svn directly
          (short_circuit). The default value of this directive is On.

   SVNListParentPath On|Off
          When set to On, allows a GET of SVNParentPath, which results in
          a listing of all repositories under that path. The default
          setting is Off.

   SVNMasterURI url
          Specifies a URI to the master Subversion repository (used for a
          write-through proxy).

   SVNActivitiesDB directory-path
          Specifies the location in the filesystem where the activities
          database should be stored. By default, mod_dav_svn creates and
          uses a directory in the repository called dav/activities.d. The
          path specified with this option must be an absolute path.

          If specified for an SVNParentPath area, mod_dav_svn appends the
          basename of the repository to the path specified here. For
          example:

<Location /svn>
  DAV svn

  # any "/svn/foo" URL will map to a repository in
  # /net/svn.nfs/repositories/foo
  SVNParentPath         "/net/svn.nfs/repositories"

  # any "/svn/foo" URL will map to an activities db in
  #  /var/db/svn/activities/foo
  SVNActivitiesDB       "/var/db/svn/activities"
</Location>

mod_authz_svn

Name

   mod_authz_svn Configuration Directives â Apache configuration
   directives for configuring path-based authorization for Subversion
   repositories served through the Apache HTTP Server.

Description

   This section briefly describes each Apache configuration directive
   offered by mod_authz_svn. For an in-depth description of using
   path-based authorization in Subversion, see the section called
   âPath-Based Authorizationâ.)

Directives

   These are the httpd.conf directives that apply to mod_authz_svn:

   AuthzSVNAccessFile file-path
          Consult file-path for access rules describing the permissions
          for paths in Subversion repository.

   AuthzSVNAnonymous On|Off
          Set to Off to disable two special-case behaviours of this
          module: interaction with the Satisfy Any directive and
          enforcement of the authorization policy even when no Require
          directives are present. The default value of this directive is
          On.

   AuthzSVNAuthoritative On|Off
          Set to Off to allow access control to be passed along to lower
          modules. The default value of this directive is On.

   AuthzSVNNoAuthWhenAnonymousAllowed On|Off
          Set to On to suppress authentication and authorization for
          requests which anonymous users are allowed to perform. The
          default value of this directive is On.

Subversion Properties

   Subversion allows users to invent arbitrarily named versioned
   properties on files and directories, as well as unversioned properties
   on revisions. The only restriction is on properties whose names begin
   with svn: (those are reserved for Subversion's own use). While these
   properties may be set by users to control Subversion's behavior, users
   may not invent new svn: properties.

Versioned Properties

   These are the versioned properties that Subversion reserves for its own
   use:

   svn:executable
          If present on a file, the client will make the file executable
          in Unix-hosted working copies. See the section called âFile
          Executabilityâ.

   svn:mime-type
          If present on a file, the value indicates the file's MIME type.
          This allows the client to decide whether line-based contextual
          merging is safe to perform during updates, and can also affect
          how the file behaves when fetched via a web browser. See the
          section called âFile Content Typeâ.

   svn:ignore
          If present on a directory, the value is a list of unversioned
          file patterns to be ignored by svn status and other subcommands.
          See the section called âIgnoring Unversioned Itemsâ.

   svn:keywords
          If present on a file, the value tells the client how to expand
          particular keywords within the file. See the section called
          âKeyword Substitutionâ.

   svn:eol-style
          If present on a file, the value tells the client how to
          manipulate the file's line-endings in the working copy and in
          exported trees. See the section called âEnd-of-Line Character
          Sequencesâ and svn export earlier in this chapter.

   svn:externals
          If present on a directory, the value is a multiline list of
          other paths and URLs the client should check out. See the
          section called âExternals Definitionsâ.

   svn:special
          If present on a file, indicates that the file is not an ordinary
          file, but a symbolic link or other special object. ^[58]

   svn:needs-lock
          If present on a file, tells the client to make the file
          read-only in the working copy, as a reminder that the file
          should be locked before editing begins. See the section called
          âLock Communicationâ.

   svn:mergeinfo
          Used by Subversion to track merge data. See the section called
          âMergeinfo and Previewsâ for details, but you should never edit
          this property unless you really know what you're doing.

Unversioned Properties

   These are the unversioned properties tht Subversion reserves for its
   own use:

   svn:author
          If present, contains the authenticated username of the person
          who created the revision. (If not present, the revision was
          committed anonymously.)

   svn:date
          Contains the UTC time the revision was created, in ISO 8601
          format. The value comes from the server machine's clock, not the
          client's.

   svn:log
          Contains the log message describing the revision.

   svn:autoversioned
          If present, the revision was created via the autoversioning
          feature. See the section called âAutoversioningâ.

Repository Hooks

   These are the repository hooks that Subversion provides:

Name

   start-commit â Notification of the beginning of a commit.

Description

   The start-commit hook is run before the commit transaction is even
   created. It is typically used to decide whether the user has commit
   privileges at all.

   If the start-commit hook program returns a nonzero exit value, the
   commit is stopped before the commit transaction is even created, and
   anything printed to stderr is marshalled back to the client.

Input Parameter(s)

   The command-line arguments passed to the hook program, in order, are:
    1. Repository path
    2. Authenticated username attempting the commit
    3. Colon-separated list of capabilities that a client passes to the
       server, including depth, mergeinfo, and log-revprops (new in
       Subversion 1.5).

Common uses

   Access control (e.g., temporarily lock out commits for some reason).

   A means to allow access only from clients that have certain
   capabilities.
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   pre-commit â Notification just prior to commit completion.

Description

   The pre-commit hook is run just before a commit transaction is promoted
   to a new revision. Typically, this hook is used to protect against
   commits that are disallowed due to content or location (e.g., your site
   might require that all commits to a certain branch include a ticket
   number from the bug tracker, or that the incoming log message is
   nonempty).

   If the pre-commit hook program returns a nonzero exit value, the commit
   is aborted, the commit transaction is removed, and anything printed to
   stderr is marshalled back to the client.

Input parameter(s)

   The command-line arguments passed to the hook program, in order, are:
    1. Repository path
    2. Commit transaction name

Common uses

   Change validation and control
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   post-commit â Notification of a successful commit.

Description

   The post-commit hook is run after the transaction is committed and a
   new revision is created. Most people use this hook to send out
   descriptive emails about the commit or to notify some other tool (such
   as an issue tracker) that a commit has happened. Some configurations
   also use this hook to trigger backup processes.

   If the post-commit hook returns a nonzero exit status, the commit will
   not be aborted since it has already completed. However, anything that
   the hook printed to stderr will be marshalled back to the client,
   making it easier to diagnose hook failures.

Input parameter(s)

   The command-line arguments passed to the hook program, in order, are:
    1. Repository path
    2. Revision number created by the commit

Common uses

   Commit notification; tool integration
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   pre-revprop-change â Notification of a revision property change
   attempt.

Description

   The pre-revprop-change hook is run immediately prior to the
   modification of a revision property when performed outside the scope of
   a normal commit. Unlike the other hooks, the default state of this one
   is to deny the proposed action. The hook must actually exist and return
   a zero exit value before a revision property modification can happen.

   If the pre-revprop-change hook doesn't exist, isn't executable, or
   returns a nonzero exit value, no change to the property will be made,
   and anything printed to stderr is marshalled back to the client.

Input parameter(s)

   The command-line arguments passed to the hook program, in order, are:
    1. Repository path
    2. Revision whose property is about to be modified
    3. Authenticated username attempting the property change
    4. Name of the property changed
    5. Change description: A (added), D (deleted), or M (modified)

   Additionally, Subversion passes the intended new value of the property
   to the hook program via standard input.

Common uses

   Access control; change validation and control
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   post-revprop-change â Notification of a successful revision property
   change.

Description

   The post-revprop-change hook is run immediately after the modification
   of a revision property when performed outside the scope of a normal
   commit. As you can derive from the description of its counterpart, the
   pre-revprop-change hook, this hook will not run at all unless the
   pre-revprop-change hook is implemented. It is typically used to send
   email notification of the property change.

   If the post-revprop-change hook returns a nonzero exit status, the
   change will not be aborted since it has already completed. However,
   anything that the hook printed to stderr will be marshalled back to the
   client, making it easier to diagnose hook failures.

Input parameter(s)

   The command-line arguments passed to the hook program, in order, are:
    1. Repository path
    2. Revision whose property was modified
    3. Authenticated username of the person making the change
    4. Name of the property changed
    5. Change description: A (added), D (deleted), or M (modified)

   Additionally, Subversion passes to the hook program, via standard
   input, the previous value of the property.

Common uses

   Property change notification
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   pre-lock â Notification of a path lock attempt.

Description

   The pre-lock hook runs whenever someone attempts to lock a path. It can
   be used to prevent locks altogether or to create a more complex policy
   specifying exactly which users are allowed to lock particular paths. If
   the hook notices a preexisting lock, it can also decide whether a user
   is allowed to âstealâ the existing lock.

   If the pre-lock hook program returns a nonzero exit value, the lock
   action is aborted and anything printed to stderr is marshalled back to
   the client.

Input parameter(s)

   The command-line arguments passed to the hook program, in order, are:
    1. Repository path
    2. Versioned path that is to be locked
    3. Authenticated username of the person attempting the lock

Common uses

   Access control
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   post-lock â Notification of a successful path lock.

Description

   The post-lock hook runs after one or more paths have been locked. It is
   typically used to send email notification of the lock event.

   If the post-lock hook returns a nonzero exit status, the lock will not
   be aborted since it has already completed. However, anything that the
   hook printed to stderr will be marshalled back to the client, making it
   easier to diagnose hook failures.

Input parameter(s)

   The command-line arguments passed to the hook program, in order, are:
    1. Repository path
    2. Authenticated username of the person who locked the paths

   Additionally, the list of paths locked is passed to the hook program
   via standard input, one path per line.

Common uses

   Lock notification
     __________________________________________________________________

Name

   pre-unlock â Notification of a path unlock attempt.

Description

   The pre-unlock hook runs whenever someone attempts to remove a lock on
   a file. It can be used to create policies that specify which users are
   allowed to unlock particular paths. It's particularly important for
   determining policies about lock breakage. If user A locks a file, is
   user B allowed to break the lock? What if the lock is more than a week
   old? These sorts of things can be decided and enforced by the hook.

   If the pre-unlock hook program returns a nonzero exit value, the unlock
   action is aborted and anything printed to stderr is marshalled back to
   the client.

Input parameter(s)

   The command-line arguments passed to the hook program, in order, are:
    1. Repository path
    2. Versioned path which is to be locked
    3. Authenticated username of the person attempting the lock

Common uses

   Access control
     __________________________________________________________________

Description

   The post-unlock hook runs after one or more paths have been unlocked.

   If the post-unlock hook returns a nonzero exit status, the unlock will
   not be aborted since it has already completed. However, anything that

   Installing Subversion
   High-Speed Tutorial

   If you're eager to get Subversion up and running (and you enjoy
   learning by experimentation), this appendix will show you how to create
   a repository, import code, and then check it back out again as a
   working copy. Along the way, we give links to the relevant chapters of
   this book.

Warning

   If you're new to the entire concept of version control or to the
   âcopy-modify-mergeâ model used by both CVS and Subversion, you should
   read Chapter 1, Fundamental Concepts before going any further.

Installing Subversion

   Subversion is built on a portability layer called APRâthe Apache
   Portable Runtime library. The APR library provides all the interfaces
   that Subversion needs to function on different operating systems: disk
   access, network access, memory management, and so on. While Subversion
   is able to use Apache as one of its network server programs, its
   dependence on APR does not mean that Apache is a required component.
   APR is a standalone library usable by any application. It does mean,
   however, that like Apache, Subversion clients and servers run on any
   operating system that the Apache httpd server runs on: Windows, Linux,
   all flavors of BSD, Mac OS X, NetWare, and others.

   The easiest way to get Subversion is to download a binary package built
   for your operating system. Subversion's web site
   (http://subversion.tigris.org) often has these packages available for
   download, posted by volunteers. The site usually contains graphical
   installer packages for users of Microsoft operating systems. If you run
   a Unix-like operating system, you can use your system's native package
   distribution system (RPMs, DEBs, the ports tree, etc.) to get
   Subversion.

   Alternatively, you can build Subversion directly from source code,
   though it's not always an easy task. (If you're not experienced at
   building open source software packages, you're probably better off
   downloading a binary distribution instead!) From the Subversion web
   site, download the latest source code release. After unpacking it,
   follow the instructions in the INSTALL file to build it. Note that a
   released source package may not contain everything you need to build a
   command-line client capable of talking to a remote repository. Starting
   with Subversion 1.4 and later, the libraries Subversion depends on
   (apr, apr-util, and neon) are distributed in a separate source package
   suffixed with -deps. These libraries are now common enough that they
   may already be installed on your system. If not, you'll need to unpack
   the dependency package into the same directory where you unpacked the
   main Subversion source. Regardless, it's possible that you may want to
   fetch other optional dependencies such as Berkeley DB and possibly
   Apache httpd. If you want to do a complete build, make sure you have
   all of the packages documented in the INSTALL file.

   If you're one of those folks that likes to use bleeding-edge software,
   you can also get the Subversion source code from the Subversion
   repository in which it lives. Obviously, you'll need to already have a
   Subversion client on hand to do this. But once you do, you can check
   out a working copy of the Subversion source repository from
   http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/: ^[59]
$ svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk subversion
A    subversion/HACKING
A    subversion/INSTALL
A    subversion/README
A    subversion/autogen.sh
A    subversion/build.conf
â¦

   The preceding command will create a working copy of the latest
   (unreleased) Subversion source code into a subdirectory named
   subversion in your current working directory. You can adjust that last
   argument as you see fit. Regardless of what you call the new working
   copy directory, though, after this operation completes, you will now
   have the Subversion source code. Of course, you will still need to
   fetch a few helper libraries (apr, apr-util, etc.)âsee the INSTALL file
   in the top level of the working copy for details.

     position and that your tray tables are stored. Flight attendants,
     prepare for take-offâ¦.â

   What follows is a quick tutorial that walks you through some basic
   Subversion configuration and operation. When you finish it, you should
   have a general understanding of Subversion's typical usage.

Note

   The examples used in this appendix assume that you have svn, the
   Subversion command-line client, and svnadmin, the administrative tool,
   ready to go on a Unix-like operating system. (This tutorial also works
   at the Windows command-line prompt, assuming you make some obvious
   tweaks.) We also assume you are using Subversion 1.2 or later (run svn
   --version to check.)

   Subversion stores all versioned data in a central repository. To begin,
   create a new repository:
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/repos
$ ls /var/svn/repos
conf/  dav/  db/  format  hooks/  locks/  README.txt

   This command creates a new directory, /var/svn/repos, which contains a
   Subversion repository. This new directory contains (among other things)
   a collection of database files. You won't see your versioned files if
   you peek inside. For more information about repository creation and
   maintenance, see Chapter 5, Repository Administration.

   Subversion has no concept of a âproject.â The repository is just a
   virtual versioned filesystem, a large tree that can hold anything you
   wish. Some administrators prefer to store only one project in a
   repository, and others prefer to store multiple projects in a
   repository by placing them into separate directories. We discuss the
   merits of each approach in the section called âPlanning Your Repository
   Organizationâ. Either way, the repository manages only files and
   directories, so it's up to humans to interpret particular directories
   as âprojects.â So while you might see references to projects throughout
   this book, keep in mind that we're only ever talking about some
   directory (or collection of directories) in the repository.

   In this example, we assume you already have some sort of project (a
   collection of files and directories) that you wish to import into your
   newly created Subversion repository. Begin by organizing your data into
   a single directory called myproject (or whatever you wish). For reasons
   explained in Chapter 4, Branching and Merging, your project's tree
   structure should contain three top-level directories named branches,
   tags, and trunk. The trunk directory should contain all of your data,
   and the branches and tags directories should be empty:
/tmp/myproject/branches/
/tmp/myproject/tags/
/tmp/myproject/trunk/
                     foo.c
                     bar.c
                     Makefile
                     â¦

   The branches, tags, and trunk subdirectories aren't actually required
   by Subversion. They're merely a popular convention that you'll most
   likely want to use later on.

   Once you have your tree of data ready to go, import it into the
   repository with the svn import command (see the section called âGetting
   Data into Your Repositoryâ):
$ svn import /tmp/myproject file:///var/svn/repos/myproject -m "initial import"
Adding         /tmp/myproject/branches
Adding         /tmp/myproject/tags
Adding         /tmp/myproject/trunk
Adding         /tmp/myproject/trunk/foo.c
Adding         /tmp/myproject/trunk/bar.c
Adding         /tmp/myproject/trunk/Makefile
â¦
Committed revision 1.
$

   Now the repository contains this tree of data. As mentioned earlier,
   you won't see your files by directly peeking into the repository;
   they're all stored within a database. But the repository's imaginary
   filesystem now contains a top-level directory named myproject, which in
   turn contains your data.

   Note that the original /tmp/myproject directory is unchanged;
   Subversion is unaware of it. (In fact, you can even delete that
   directory if you wish.) To start manipulating repository data, you need
   to create a new âworking copyâ of the data, a sort of private
   workspace. Ask Subversion to âcheck outâ a working copy of the
   myproject/trunk directory in the repository:
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos/myproject/trunk myproject
A  myproject/foo.c
A  myproject/bar.c
A  myproject/Makefile
â¦
Checked out revision 1.

   Now you have a personal copy of part of the repository in a new
   directory named myproject. You can edit the files in your working copy
   and then commit those changes back into the repository.
     * Enter your working copy and edit a file's contents.
     * Run svn diff to see unified diff output of your changes.
     * Run svn commit to commit the new version of your file to the
       repository.
     * Run svn update to bring your working copy âup to dateâ with the
       repository.

   For a full tour of all the things you can do with your working copy,
   read Chapter 2, Basic Usage.

   At this point, you have the option of making your repository available
   to others over a network. See Chapter 6, Server Configuration to learn
   about the different sorts of server processes available and how to
   configure them.
   __________________________________________________________________

   ^[59] Note that the URL checked out in the example ends not with svn,
   but with a subdirectory thereof called trunk. See our discussion of
   Subversion's branching and tagging model for the reasoning behind this.

   Converting a Repository from CVS to Subversion

   This appendix is a guide for CVS users new to Subversion. It's
   essentially a list of differences between the two systems as âviewed
   from 10,000 feet.â For each section, we provide references to relevant
   chapters when possible.

   Although the goal of Subversion is to take over the current and future
   CVS user base, some new features and design changes were required to
   fix certain âbrokenâ behaviors that CVS had. This means that, as a CVS
   user, you may need to break habitsâones that you forgot were odd to
   begin with.

Revision Numbers Are Different Now

   In CVS, revision numbers are per file. This is because CVS stores its
   data in RCS files; each file has a corresponding RCS file in the
   repository, and the repository is roughly laid out according to the
   structure of your project tree.

   In Subversion, the repository looks like a single filesystem. Each
   commit results in an entirely new filesystem tree; in essence, the
   repository is an array of trees. Each of these trees is labeled with a
   single revision number. When someone talks about ârevision 54â, he's
   talking about a particular tree (and indirectly, the way the filesystem
   looked after the 54th commit).

   Technically, it's not valid to talk about ârevision 5 of foo.c.â
   Instead, one would say âfoo.c as it appears in revision 5.â Also, be
   careful when making assumptions about the evolution of a file. In CVS,
   revisions 5 and 6 of foo.c are always different. In Subversion, it's
   most likely that foo.c did not change between revisions 5 and 6.

   Similarly, in CVS, a tag or branch is an annotation on the file or on
   the version information for that individual file, whereas in
   Subversion, a tag or branch is a copy of an entire tree (by convention,
   into the /branches or /tags directories that appear at the top level of
   the repository, beside /trunk). In the repository as a whole, many
   versions of each file may be visible: the latest version on each
   branch, every tagged version, and of course the latest version on the
   trunk itself. So, to refine the terms even further, one would often say
   âfoo.c as it appears in /branches/REL1 in revision 5.â

   For more details on this topic, see the section called âRevisionsâ.

Directory Versions

   Subversion tracks tree structures, not just file contents. It's one of
   the biggest reasons Subversion was written to replace CVS.

   Here's what this means to you, as a former CVS user:
     * The svn add and svn delete commands work on directories now, just
       as they work on files. So do svn copy and svn move. However, these
       commands do not cause any kind of immediate change in the
       repository. Instead, the working items are simply âscheduledâ for
       addition or deletion. No repository changes happen until you run
       svn commit.
     * Directories aren't dumb containers anymore; they have revision
       numbers like files. (Or more properly, it's correct to talk about
       âdirectory foo/ in revision 5.â)

   Let's talk more about that last point. Directory versioning is a hard
   problem; because we want to allow mixed-revision working copies, there
   are some limitations on how far we can abuse this model.

   From a theoretical point of view, we define ârevision 5 of directory
   fooâ to mean a specific collection of directory entries and properties.
   Now suppose we start adding and removing files from foo, and then
   commit. It would be a lie to say that we still have revision 5 of foo.
   However, if we bumped foo's revision number after the commit, that
   would be a lie too; there may be other changes to foo we haven't yet
   received, because we haven't updated yet.

   Subversion deals with this problem by quietly tracking committed adds
   and deletes in the .svn area. When you eventually run svn update, all
   accounts are settled with the repository, and the directory's new
   revision number is set correctly. Therefore, only after an update is it
   truly safe to say that you have a âperfectâ revision of a directory.
   Most of the time, your working copy will contain âimperfectâ directory
   revisions.

   Similarly, a problem arises if you attempt to commit property changes
   on a directory. Normally, the commit would bump the working directory's
   local revision number. But again, that would be a lie, as there may be
   adds or deletes that the directory doesn't yet have, because no update
   has happened. Therefore, you are not allowed to commit property changes
   on a directory unless the directory is up to date.

   For more discussion about the limitations of directory versioning, see
   the section called âMixed Revision Working Copiesâ.

More Disconnected Operations

   In recent years, disk space has become outrageously cheap and abundant,
   but network bandwidth has not. Therefore, the Subversion working copy
   has been optimized around the scarcer resource.

   The .svn administrative directory serves the same purpose as the CVS
   directory, except that it also stores read-only, âpristineâ copies of
   your files. This allows you to do many things offline:

   svn status
          Shows you any local changes you've made (see the section called
          âSee an overview of your changesâ)

   svn diff
          Shows you the details of your changes (see the section called
          âExamine the details of your local modificationsâ)

   svn revert
          Removes your local changes (see the section called âUndoing
          Working Changesâ)

   Also, the cached pristine files allow the Subversion client to send
   differences when committing, which CVS cannot do.

   The last subcommand in the listâsvn revertâis new. It will not only
   remove local changes, but also unschedule operations such as adds and
   deletes. Although deleting the file and then running svn update will
   still work, doing so distorts the true purpose of updating. And, while
   we're on this subjectâ¦

Distinction Between Status and Update

   Subversion attempts to erase a lot of the confusion between the cvs
   status and cvs update commands.

   The cvs status command has two purposes: first, to show the user any
   local modifications in the working copy, and second, to show the user
   which files are out of date. Unfortunately, because of CVS's
   hard-to-read status output, many CVS users don't take advantage of this
   command at all. Instead, they've developed a habit of running cvs
   update or cvs -n update to quickly see their changes. If users forget
   to use the -n option, this has the side effect of merging repository
   changes they may not be ready to deal with.

   Subversion removes this muddle by making the output of svn status easy
   to read for both humans and parsers. Also, svn update prints only
   information about files that are updated, not local modifications.

Status

   svn status prints all files that have local modifications. By default,
   the repository is not contacted. While this subcommand accepts a fair
   number of options, the following are the most commonly used ones:

   -u
          Contact the repository to determine, and then display,
          out-of-dateness information.

   -v
          Show all entries under version control.

   -N
          Run nonrecursively (do not descend into subdirectories).

   The svn status command has two output formats. In the default âshortâ
   format, local modifications look like this:
$ svn status
M      foo.c
M      bar/baz.c

   If you specify the --show-updates (-u) option, a longer output format
   is used:
$ svn status -u
M            1047   foo.c
       *     1045   faces.html
       *            bloo.png
M            1050   bar/baz.c
Status against revision:   1066

   In this case, two new columns appear. The second column contains an
   asterisk if the file or directory is out of date. The third column
   shows the working copy's revision number of the item. In the previous
   example, the asterisk indicates that faces.html would be patched if we
   updated, and that bloo.png is a newly added file in the repository.
   (The absence of any revision number next to bloo.png means that it
   doesn't yet exist in the working copy.)

   At this point, you should take a quick look at the list of all possible
   status codes in svn status. Here are a few of the more common status
   codes you'll see:
A    Resource is scheduled for Addition
D    Resource is scheduled for Deletion
M    Resource has local Modifications
C    Resource has Conflicts (changes have not been completely merged
       between the repository and working copy version)
X    Resource is eXternal to this working copy (may come from another
       repository).  See the section called âExternals Definitionsâ
?    Resource is not under version control
!    Resource is missing or incomplete (removed by a tool other than
       Subversion)

   For a more detailed discussion of svn status, see the section called
   âSee an overview of your changesâ.

Update

   svn update updates your working copy, and prints only information about
   files that it updates.

   Subversion has combined CVS's P and U codes into just U. When a merge
   or conflict occurs, Subversion simply prints G or C, rather than a
   whole sentence about it.

   For a more detailed discussion of svn update, see the section called
   âUpdate Your Working Copyâ.

Branches and Tags

   Subversion doesn't distinguish between filesystem space and âbranchâ
   space; branches and tags are ordinary directories within the
   filesystem. This is probably the single biggest mental hurdle that a
   CVS user will need to cross. Read all about it in Chapter 4, Branching
   and Merging.

Warning

   Since Subversion treats branches and tags as ordinary directories, your
   project's various lines of development probably live in subdirectories
   of the main project directory. So remember to check out using the URL
   of the subdirectory that contains the particular line of development
   you want, not the project's root URL. If you make the mistake of
   checking out the root of the project, you may very well wind up with a
   working copy that contains a complete copy of your project's content
   for each and every one of its branches and tags. ^[60]

Metadata Properties

   A new feature of Subversion is that you can attach arbitrary metadata
   (or âpropertiesâ) to files and directories. Properties are arbitrary
   name/value pairs associated with files and directories in your working
   copy.

   To set or get a property name, use the svn propset and svn propget
   subcommands. To list all properties on an object, use svn proplist.

   For more information, see the section called âPropertiesâ.

Conflict Resolution

   CVS marks conflicts with inline âconflict markers,â and then prints a C
   during an update or merge operation. Historically, this has caused
   problems, because CVS isn't doing enough. Many users forget about (or
   don't see) the C after it whizzes by on their terminal. They often
   forget that the conflict markers are even present, and then
   accidentally commit files containing those conflict markers.

   Subversion solves this problem in a pair of ways. First, when a
   conflict occurs in a file, Subversion records the fact that the file is
   in a state of conflict, and won't allow you to commit changes to that
   file until you explicitly resolve the conflict. Second, Subversion 1.5
   provides interactive conflict resolution, which allows you to resolve
   conflicts as they happen instead of having to go back and do so after
   the update or merge operation completes. See the section called
   âResolve Conflicts (Merging Others' Changes)â for more about conflict
   resolution in Subversion.

Binary Files and Translation

   In the most general sense, Subversion handles binary files more
   gracefully than CVS does. Because CVS uses RCS, it can only store
   successive full copies of a changing binary file. Subversion, however,
   expresses differences between files using a binary differencing
   algorithm, regardless of whether they contain textual or binary data.
   That means all files are stored differentially (compressed) in the
   repository.

   CVS users have to mark binary files with -kb flags to prevent data from
   being garbled (due to keyword expansion and line-ending translations).
   They sometimes forget to do this.

   Subversion takes the more paranoid route. First, it never performs any
   kind of keyword or line-ending translation unless you explicitly ask it
   to do so (see the section called âKeyword Substitutionâ and the section
   called âEnd-of-Line Character Sequencesâ for more details). By default,
   Subversion treats all file data as literal byte strings, and files are
   always stored in the repository in an untranslated state.

   Second, Subversion maintains an internal notion of whether a file is
   âtextâ or âbinaryâ data, but this notion is only extant in the working
   copy. During an svn update, Subversion will perform contextual merges
   on locally modified text files, but will not attempt to do so for
   binary files.

   To determine whether a contextual merge is possible, Subversion
   examines the svn:mime-type property. If the file has no svn:mime-type
   property, or has a MIME type that is textual (e.g., text/*), Subversion
   assumes it is text. Otherwise, Subversion assumes the file is binary.
   Subversion also helps users by running a binary-detection algorithm in
   the svn import and svn add commands. These commands will make a good
   guess and then (possibly) set a binary svn:mime-type property on the
   file being added. (If Subversion guesses wrong, the user can always
   remove or hand-edit the property.)

Versioned Modules

   Unlike CVS, a Subversion working copy is aware that it has checked out
   a module. That means if somebody changes the definition of a module
   (e.g., adds or removes components), a call to svn update will update
   the working copy appropriately, adding and removing components.

   Subversion defines modules as a list of directories within a directory
   property; see the section called âExternals Definitionsâ.

Authentication

   With CVS's pserver, you are required to log in to the server (using the
   cvs login command) before performing any read or write operationâyou
   sometimes even have to log in for anonymous operations. With a
   Subversion repository using Apache httpd or svnserve as the server, you
   don't provide any authentication credentials at the outsetâif an
   operation that you perform requires authentication, the server will
   challenge you for your credentials (whether those credentials are
   username and password, a client certificate, or even both). So if your
   repository is world-readable, you will not be required to authenticate
   at all for read operations.

   As with CVS, Subversion still caches your credentials on disk (in your
   ~/.subversion/auth/ directory) unless you tell it not to by using the
   --no-auth-cache option.

   The exception to this behavior, however, is in the case of accessing an
   svnserve server over an SSH tunnel, using the svn+ssh:// URL scheme. In
   that case, the ssh program unconditionally demands authentication just
   to start the tunnel.

Converting a Repository from CVS to Subversion

   Perhaps the most important way to familiarize CVS users with Subversion
   is to let them continue to work on their projects using the new system.
   And while that can be somewhat accomplished using a flat import into a
   Subversion repository of an exported CVS repository, the more thorough
   solution involves transferring not just the latest snapshot of their
   data, but all the history behind it as well, from one system to
   another. This is an extremely difficult problem to solve; it involves
   deducing changesets in the absence of atomicity and translating between
   the systems' completely orthogonal branching policies, among other
   complications. Still, a handful of tools claim to at least partially
   support the ability to convert existing CVS repositories into
   Subversion ones.

   The most popular (and mature) conversion tool is cvs2svn
   (http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/), a Python program originally created by
   members of Subversion's own development community. This tool is meant
   to run exactly once: it scans your CVS repository multiple times and
   attempts to deduce commits, branches, and tags as best it can. When it
   finishes, the result is either a Subversion repository or a portable
   Subversion dump file representing your code's history. See the web site
   for detailed instructions and caveats.

   WebDAV is an extension to HTTP, and it is growing more and more popular
   as a standard for file sharing. Today's operating systems are becoming
   extremely web-aware, and many now have built-in support for mounting
   âsharesâ exported by WebDAV servers.

   If you use Apache as your Subversion network server, to some extent you
   are also running a WebDAV server. This appendix gives some background
   on the nature of this protocol, how Subversion uses it, and how well
   Subversion interoperates with other software that is WebDAV-aware.

What Is WebDAV?

   DAV stands for âDistributed Authoring and Versioning.â RFC 2518 defines
   a set of concepts and accompanying extension methods to HTTP 1.1 that
   make the Web a more universal read/write medium. The basic idea is that
   a WebDAV-compliant web server can act like a generic file server;
   clients can âmountâ shared folders over HTTP that behave much like
   other network filesystems (such as NFS or SMB).

   The tragedy, though, is that despite the acronym, the RFC specification
   doesn't actually describe any sort of version control. Basic WebDAV
   clients and servers assume that only one version of each file or
   directory exists, and that it can be repeatedly overwritten.

   Because RFC 2518 left out versioning concepts, another committee was
   left with the responsibility of writing RFC 3253 a few years later. The
   new RFC adds versioning concepts to WebDAV, placing the âVâ back in
   âDAVââhence the term âDeltaV.â WebDAV/DeltaV clients and servers are
   often called just âDeltaVâ programs, since DeltaV implies the existence
   of basic WebDAV.

   The original WebDAV standard has been widely successful. Every modern
   computer operating system has a general WebDAV client built in (details
   to follow), and a number of popular standalone applications are also
   able to speak WebDAVâMicrosoft Office, Dreamweaver, and Photoshop, to
   name a few. On the server end, Apache HTTP Server has been able to
   provide WebDAV services since 1998 and is considered the de facto open
   source standard. Several other commercial WebDAV servers are available,
   including Microsoft's own IIS.

   DeltaV, unfortunately, has not been so successful. It's very difficult
   to find any DeltaV clients or servers. The few that do exist are
   relatively unknown commercial products, and thus it's very difficult to
   test interoperability. It's not entirely clear as to why DeltaV has
   remained stagnant. Some opine that the specification is just too
   complex. Others argue that while WebDAV's features have mass appeal
   (even the least technical users appreciate network file sharing), its
   version control features just aren't interesting or necessary for most
   users. Finally, some believe that DeltaV remains unpopular because
   there's still no open source server product that implements it well.

   When Subversion was still in its design phase, it seemed like a great
   idea to use Apache as a network server. It already had a module to
   provide WebDAV services. DeltaV was a relatively new specification. The
   hope was that the Subversion server module (mod_dav_svn) would
   eventually evolve into an open source DeltaV reference implementation.
   Unfortunately, DeltaV has a very specific versioning model that doesn't
   quite line up with Subversion's model. Some concepts were mappable;
   others were not.

   What does this mean, then?

   First, the Subversion client is not a fully implemented DeltaV client.
   It needs certain types of things from the server that DeltaV itself
   cannot provide, and thus is largely dependent on a number of
   Subversion-specific HTTP REPORT requests that only mod_dav_svn
   understands.

   Second, mod_dav_svn is not a fully realized DeltaV server. Many
   portions of the DeltaV specification were irrelevant to Subversion, and
   thus were left unimplemented.

   There is still some debate in the developer community as to whether or
   not it's worthwhile to remedy either of these situations. It's fairly
   unrealistic to change Subversion's design to match DeltaV, so there's
   probably no way the client can ever learn to get everything it needs
   from a general DeltaV server. On the other hand, mod_dav_svn could be
   further developed to implement all of DeltaV, but it's hard to find
   motivation to do soâthere are almost no DeltaV clients to interoperate
   with.

Autoversioning

   While the Subversion client is not a full DeltaV client, and the
   Subversion server is not a full DeltaV server, there's still a glimmer
   of WebDAV interoperability to be happy about: autoversioning.

   Autoversioning is an optional feature defined in the DeltaV standard. A
   typical DeltaV server will reject an ignorant WebDAV client attempting
   to do a PUT to a file that's under version control. To change a
   version-controlled file, the server expects a series of proper
   versioning requests: something like MKACTIVITY, CHECKOUT, PUT, CHECKIN.
   But if the DeltaV server supports autoversioning, write requests from
   basic WebDAV clients are accepted. The server behaves as though the
   client had issued the proper series of versioning requests, performing
   a commit under the hood. In other words, it allows a DeltaV server to
   interoperate with ordinary WebDAV clients that don't understand
   versioning.

   Because so many operating systems already have integrated WebDAV
   clients, the use case for this feature can be incredibly appealing to
   administrators working with non-technical users. Imagine an office of
   ordinary users running Microsoft Windows or Mac OS. Each user âmountsâ
   the Subversion repository, which appears to be an ordinary network
   folder. They use the shared folder as they always do: open files, edit
   them, and save them. Meanwhile, the server is automatically versioning
   everything. Any administrator (or knowledgeable user) can still use a
   Subversion client to search history and retrieve older versions of
   data.

   This scenario isn't fictionâit's real and it works, as of Subversion
   1.2 and later. To activate autoversioning in mod_dav_svn, use the
   SVNAutoversioning directive within the httpd.conf Location block, like
   so:
<Location /repos>
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
  SVNAutoversioning on
</Location>

   When Subversion autoversioning is active, write requests from WebDAV
   clients result in automatic commits. A generic log message is
   automatically generated and attached to each revision.

   Before activating this feature, however, understand what you're getting
   into. WebDAV clients tend to do many write requests, resulting in a
   huge number of automatically committed revisions. For example, when
   saving data, many clients will do a PUT of a 0-byte file (as a way of
   reserving a name) followed by another PUT with the real file data. The
   single file-write results in two separate commits. Also consider that
   many applications auto-save every few minutes, resulting in even more
   commits.

   If you have a post-commit hook program that sends email, you may want
   to disable email generation either altogether or on certain sections of
   the repository; it depends on whether you think the influx of emails
   will still prove to be valuable notifications or not. Also, a smart
   post-commit hook program can distinguish between a transaction created
   via autoversioning and one created through a normal Subversion commit
   operation. The trick is to look for a revision property named
   svn:autoversioned. If present, the commit was made by a generic WebDAV
   client.

   Another feature that may be a useful complement for Subversion's
   autoversioning comes from Apache's mod_mime module. If a WebDAV client
   adds a new file to the repository, there's no opportunity for the user
   to set the the svn:mime-type property. This might cause the file to
   appear as a generic icon when viewed within a WebDAV shared folder, not
   having an association with any application. One remedy is to have a
   sysadmin (or other Subversion-knowledgeable person) check out a working
   copy and manually set the svn:mime-type property on necessary files.
   But there's potentially no end to such cleanup tasks. Instead, you can
   use the ModMimeUsePathInfo directive in your Subversion <Location>
   block:
<Location /repos>
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
  SVNAutoversioning on

  ModMimeUsePathInfo on

</Location>

   This directive allows mod_mime to attempt automatic deduction of the
   MIME type on new files that enter the repository via autoversioning.
   The module looks at the file's named extension and possibly the
   contents as well; if the file matches some common patterns, the file's
   svn:mime-type property will be set automatically.

Client Interoperability

   All WebDAV clients fall into one of three categoriesâstandalone
   applications, file-explorer extensions, or filesystem implementations.
   These categories broadly define the types of WebDAV functionality
   available to users. Table C.1, âCommon WebDAV clientsâ gives our
   categorization as well as a quick description of some common pieces of
   WebDAV-enabled software. You can find more details about these software
   offerings, as well as their general category, in the sections that
   follow.

Standalone WebDAV Applications

   A WebDAV application is a program that speaks WebDAV protocols with a
   WebDAV server. We'll cover some of the most popular programs with this
   kind of WebDAV support.

Microsoft Office, Dreamweaver, Photoshop

   On Windows, several well-known applications contain integrated WebDAV
   client functionality, such as Microsoft's Office, ^[61] Adobe's
   Photoshop and Dreamweaver programs. They're able to directly open and
   save to URLs, and tend to make heavy use of WebDAV locks when editing a
   file.

   Note that while many of these programs also exist for Mac OS X, they do
   not appear to support WebDAV directly on that platform. In fact, on Mac
   OS X, the FileâOpen dialog box doesn't allow one to type a path or URL
   at all. It's likely that the WebDAV features were deliberately left out
   of Macintosh versions of these programs, since OS X already provides
   such excellent low-level filesystem support for WebDAV.

cadaver, DAV Explorer

   cadaver is a bare-bones Unix command-line program for browsing and
   changing WebDAV shares. Like the Subversion client, it uses the neon
   HTTP libraryânot surprisingly, since both neon and cadaver are written
   by the same author. cadaver is free software (GPL license) and is
   available at http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/.

   Using cadaver is similar to using a command-line FTP program, and thus
   it's extremely useful for basic WebDAV debugging. It can be used to
   upload or download files in a pinch, to examine properties, and to
   copy, move, lock, or unlock files:
$ cadaver http://host/repos
dav:/repos/> ls
Listing collection `/repos/': succeeded.
Coll: > foobar                                 0  May 10 16:19
      > playwright.el                       2864  May  4 16:18
      > proofbypoem.txt                     1461  May  5 15:09
      > westcoast.jpg                      66737  May  5 15:09

dav:/repos/> put README
Uploading README to `/repos/README':
Progress: [=============================>] 100.0% of 357 bytes succeeded.

dav:/repos/> get proofbypoem.txt
Downloading `/repos/proofbypoem.txt' to proofbypoem.txt:
Progress: [=============================>] 100.0% of 1461 bytes succeeded.

   DAV Explorer is another standalone WebDAV client, written in Java. It's
   under a free Apache-like license and is available at
   http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/. It does everything cadaver does, but
   has the advantages of being portable and being a more user-friendly GUI
   application. It's also one of the first clients to support the new
   WebDAV Access Control Protocol (RFC 3744).

   Of course, DAV Explorer's ACL support is useless in this case, since
   mod_dav_svn doesn't support it. The fact that both cadaver and DAV
   Explorer support some limited DeltaV commands isn't particularly useful
   either, since they don't allow MKACTIVITY requests. But it's not
   relevant anyway; we're assuming all of these clients are operating
   against an autoversioning repository.

File-Explorer WebDAV Extensions

   Some popular file explorer GUI programs support WebDAV extensions that
   allow a user to browse a DAV share as though it was just another
   directory on the local computer, and to perform basic tree editing
   operations on the items in that share. For example, Windows Explorer is
   able to browse a WebDAV server as a ânetwork place.â Users can drag
   files to and from the desktop, or can rename, copy, or delete files in
   the usual way. But because it's only a feature of the file explorer,
   the DAV share isn't visible to ordinary applications. All DAV
   interaction must happen through the explorer interface.

Microsoft Web Folders

   Microsoft was one of the original backers of the WebDAV specification,
   and first started shipping a client in Windows 98, which was known as
   Web Folders. This client was also shipped in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows
   2000.

   The original Web Folders client was an extension to Explorer, the main
   GUI program used to browse filesystems. It works well enough. In
   Windows 98, the feature might need to be explicitly installed if Web
   Folders aren't already visible inside My Computer. In Windows 2000,
   simply add a new ânetwork place,â enter the URL, and the WebDAV share
   will pop up for browsing.

   With the release of Windows XP, Microsoft started shipping a new
   implementation of Web Folders, known as the WebDAV Mini-Redirector. The
   new implementation is a filesystem-level client, allowing WebDAV shares
   to be mounted as drive letters. Unfortunately, this implementation is
   incredibly buggy. The client usually tries to convert HTTP URLs
   (http://host/repos) into UNC share notation (\\host\repos); it also
   often tries to use Windows Domain authentication to respond to
   basic-auth HTTP challenges, sending usernames as HOST\username. These
   interoperability problems are severe and are documented in numerous
   places around the Web, to the frustration of many users. Even Greg
   Stein, the original author of Apache's WebDAV module, bluntly states
   that XP Web Folders simply can't operate against an Apache server.

   Windows Vista's initial implementation of Web Folders seems to be
   almost the same as XP's, so it has the same sort of problems. With
   luck, Microsoft will remedy these issues in a Vista Service Pack.

   However, there seem to be workarounds for both XP and Vista that allow
   Web Folders to work against Apache. Users have mostly reported success
   with these techniques, so we'll relay them here.

   On Windows XP, you have two options. First, search Microsoft's web site
   for update KB90730, âSoftware Update for Web Folders.â This may fix all
   your problems. If it doesn't, it seems that the original pre-XP Web
   Folders implementation is still buried within the system. You can
   unearth it by going to Network Places and adding a new network place.
   When prompted, enter the URL of the repository, but include a port
   number in the URL. For example, you should enter http://host/repos as
   http://host:80/repos instead. Respond to any authentication prompts
   with your Subversion credentials.

   On Windows Vista, the same KB90730 update may clear everything up. But
   there may still be other issues. Some users have reported that Vista
   considers all http:// connections insecure, and thus will always fail
   any authentication challenges from Apache unless the connection happens
   over https://. If you're unable to connect to the Subversion repository
   via SSL, you can tweak the system registry to turn off this behavior.
   Just change the value of the
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Paramete
   rs\BasicAuthLevel key from 1 to 2. A final warning: be sure to set up
   the Web Folder to point to the repository's root directory (/), rather
   than some subdirectory such as /trunk. Vista Web Folders seems to work
   only against repository roots.

   In general, while these workarounds may function for you, you might get
   a better overall experience using a third-party WebDAV client such as
   WebDrive or NetDrive.

Nautilus, Konqueror

   Nautilus is the official file manager/browser for the GNOME desktop
   (http://www.gnome.org), and Konqueror is the manager/browser for the
   KDE desktop (http://www.kde.org). Both of these applications have an
   explorer-level WebDAV client built in, and they operate just fine
   against an autoversioning repository.

   In GNOME's Nautilus, select the FileâOpen location menu item and enter
   the URL in the dialog box presented. The repository should then be
   displayed like any other filesystem.

   In KDE's Konqueror, you need to use the webdav:// scheme when entering
   the URL in the location bar. If you enter an http:// URL, Konqueror
   will behave like an ordinary web browser. You'll likely see the generic
   HTML directory listing produced by mod_dav_svn. When you enter
   webdav://host/repos instead of http://host/repos, Konqueror becomes a
   WebDAV client and displays the repository as a filesystem.

WebDAV Filesystem Implementation

   The WebDAV filesystem implementation is arguably the best sort of
   WebDAV client. It's implemented as a low-level filesystem module,
   typically within the operating system's kernel. This means that the DAV
   share is mounted like any other network filesystem, similar to mounting
   an NFS share on Unix or attaching an SMB share as a drive letter in
   Windows. As a result, this sort of client provides completely
   transparent read/write WebDAV access to all programs. Applications
   aren't even aware that WebDAV requests are happening.

WebDrive, NetDrive

   Both WebDrive and NetDrive are excellent commercial products that allow
   a WebDAV share to be attached as drive letters in Windows. As a result,
   you can operate on the contents of these WebDAV-backed pseudodrives as
   easily as you can against real local hard drives, and in the same ways.
   You can purchase WebDrive from South River Technologies
   (http://www.southrivertech.com). Novell's NetDrive is freely available
   online, but requires users to have a NetWare license.

Mac OS X

   Apple's OS X operating system has an integrated filesystem-level WebDAV
   client. From the Finder, select the GoâConnect to Server menu item.
   Enter a WebDAV URL, and it appears as a disk on the desktop, just like
   any other mounted volume. You can also mount a WebDAV share from the
   Darwin terminal by using the webdav filesystem type with the mount
   command:
$ mount -t webdav http://svn.example.com/repos/project /some/mountpoint
$

   Note that if your mod_dav_svn is older than version 1.2, OS X will
   refuse to mount the share as read/write; it will appear as read-only.
   This is because OS X insists on locking support for read/write shares,
   and the ability to lock files first appeared in Subversion 1.2.

   Also, OS X's WebDAV client can sometimes be overly sensitive to HTTP
   redirects. If OS X is unable to mount the repository at all, you may
   need to enable the BrowserMatch directive in the Apache server's
   httpd.conf:
BrowserMatch "^WebDAVFS/1.[012]" redirect-carefully

Linux davfs2

   Linux davfs2 is a filesystem module for the Linux kernel, whose
   development is organized at http://dav.sourceforge.net/. Once you
   install davfs2, you can mount a WebDAV network share using the usual
   Linux mount command:
$ mount.davfs http://host/repos /mnt/dav
   __________________________________________________________________

   ^[61] WebDAV support was removed from Microsoft Access for some reason,
   but it exists in the rest of the Office suite.

      the Collective Works;

   b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

   c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
      perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital
      audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
      Collective Works;

   d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
      perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital
      audio transmission Derivative Works.

   e.

      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor
            waives the exclusive right to collect, whether
            individually or via a performance rights society
            (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
            performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
            of the Work.

        ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives
            the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or
            via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry
            Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
            the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
            compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
            Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

   f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
      doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
      exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
      performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for
      the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
      subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
      of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
      jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
      License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
      Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of
      the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any
      terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this
      License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact
      all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
      warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
      perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
      technological measures that control access or use of the Work in
      a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License
      Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work
      apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
      this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from
      any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
      the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the
      Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,
      upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
      practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to
      such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

   b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
      Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for
      the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
      medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
      pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the
      title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
      practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
      Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
      URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
      information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work,
      a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
      (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
      "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such
      credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
      however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
      Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
      comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
      prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
   LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
   OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
   WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
      License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative
      Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,
      will not have their licenses terminated provided such
      individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
      licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
      termination of this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
      right to release the Work under different license terms or to
      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work
      or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
      license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
      license granted to You under this License.

   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
      Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
      the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
      license granted to You under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
      to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
      or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
      You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
      agreement of the Licensor and You.

Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty
whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be
liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the
Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark
"Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative
Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any
permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons'
then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its
