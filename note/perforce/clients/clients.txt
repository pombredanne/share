////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
** Clients to the Perforce system fall into roughly five categories: Git, command, GUI, web, and plugin. The Perforce system can make part or all of its content available as Git repositories. Users of Git and of other clients can work with the same file content and history. Git commits are visible to users of other clients as Perforce changelists, and vice versa.
** The original command interface is P4, the command-line client. P4 can be used in any command shell or script. The command interfaces support the system's complete client functionality and can be used with OS-native filename syntax, as well as with Perforce's OS-neutral filename syntax. 這裡的 "filename syntax" 指的是什麼??
** Two GUI clients are available for users, the cross-platform, Qt-based P4V, and the Windows-only P4Win. Both support the majority of end-user operations. An administration GUI client, P4Admin, supports a subset of administrative operations.
** A web interface is provided by P4Web,[7] a program that is both a Perforce client and a stand-alone HTTP daemon. P4Web can be run as a shared web server to provide read-only access to the Perforce file repository and metadata. It can also be run on a user's machine, enabling web browsers to become the interface to client operations on the local machine.
