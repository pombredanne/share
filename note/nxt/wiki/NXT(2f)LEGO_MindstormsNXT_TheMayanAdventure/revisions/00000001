James Floyd Kelly (Jim) is a freelance technical writer and currently lives in Atlanta, Georgia. With degrees in English and Industrial Engineering, his friends and family often wondered what he was thinking about when he made tparthat decision. __'''Well, he somehow managed to(設法) turn his skills into a career where he gets to play with robots, new software, and other technologies. (玩機器人、新技術也可以賺錢, 真是令人羨慕的工作)''' Jim was one of the original ''http://mindstorms.lego.com/MeetMDP/[Mindstorms Developer Program (MDP)]'' participants(參與者) selected by Lego to test the new Mindstorms NXT ''robotics kit'', and he contributes with other NXT fans to The NXT Step Blog (http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com). He is also a member of the ''Mindstorms Community Partners (MCP)'', a group of NXT testers that continues to work with Lego on the NXT product line.__

== Introduction ==

Welcome to LEGO Mindstorms NXT: The Mayan(馬雅文明) Adventure. I don’t like to make assumptions, but since you’re holding this book, I’m guessing that you are either an owner of the new Lego Mindstorms NXT robotics kit or are interested in the robotics kit and what can be done with it. (Or maybe you just thought the cover looked interesting and were wondering what robots have to do with the ancient(古代的) Mayan civilization(文明).)

This book is fairly unique, and I’ll tell you why. For the earlier version of Mindstorms (called Mindstorms Robotics Invention System, or RIS for short), numerous books were written, most of which focus on building rather extravagant(怪異的) robots, hacking the Mindstorms processor (called the Brick), and doing other wild(瘋狂的) things with the product. And the books are great! __Many of them show you, step by step, how to build and program ''very unique creations''. But after reading them, I felt that a few things were missing.__

__'''The first thing I noticed was a minimal amount of “where to start” type information.''' The first time you open up a Mindstorms robotics kit, you might feel a little overwhelmed(不知所措) at the sheer number of pieces (almost all of them small) in the box. You get an instruction manual and some sample robots to build, but there is very little information for those new designers who are asking “How do I start designing a robot?”__

__'''The second item I found lacking was incentive(動機). There are lots of robots that can be built, but many Mindstorms owners get stuck trying to come up with a problem to solve. “What should I build?” is a frequently asked question. (這跟學寫程式的狀況是一樣的, 必須要找專題來自我挑戰)''' There are robotics competitions, with fixed tasks to complete and well-defined conditions for winning, but what if you’re not into competitions or lack access to them? Where can a person find challenges to take on and accomplish?__

__The last gap involves training. Many of the books on the market for the RIS are great at telling you how to build and program your robots, but '''many times the explanations aren’t really explanations—they’re ''instructions'': “Put this piece here” and “Drop that there.” What is missing are the ''reasons for doing something'' (or, at least, the authors’ reasons; 如果從頭到尾只是跟著做, 就稱不上是 "訓練" 了).'''__

With The Mayan Adventure, I’ve tried to fill in these gaps as follows:

 * To answer the question “How do I start designing a robot?” I’ve provided something called a ''Design Journal'' page. This is a ''worksheet(工作表)'' that I use (and encourage you to use) to demonstrate the development of the book’s robots, using a step-by-step method. It’s not the only method out there, but it’s my hope that you will find it useful as a way to keep your thoughts organized and to help you move forward in a constructive(建設性的) way.
 
 * As for lack of incentive, __I’ve divided the book into five sections, each of which involves a challenge. Each section has part of a fictional(虛構的) storyline(故事情節) that ''sets up a reason for building a robot''. '''The story is fictional, but the challenges give you plenty of encouragement to experiment and develop your own robots.'''__
 
 * And when it comes to training, I provide solutions to the five challenges by walking you through the development of my robots, their construction, and their programming. I give you some “Do this” and “Do that,” but always with an explanation.

I don’t use a lot of fancy, technical terms. There are some in there (it’s unavoidable when dealing with programming), but I think you’ll find that the book is written in an easy-to-follow way and, hopefully, you’ll also find the process fun.

If you’re completely unfamiliar with NXT, you really should install the NXT-G software (the CD that comes with the kit) and go through the included tutorials. These tutorials will teach you the basics of how to use the software as well as give you some basic construction skills. To get the most out of this book, you do need to at least be comfortable with using the NXT components, opening the NXT-G software, creating and saving programs, and uploading programs to your robot. If you’re comfortable with this short list, then you’re almost ready to start . . .

=== How This Book Is Organized ===

As I mentioned earlier, I’ve divided the book into five sections. Each section is further divided into four chapters. The fictional storyline starts in Chapter 1, continues in Chapters 5, 9, 13, and 17, and concludes in Chapter 21. __The storyline is where you find the details of a particular challenge (for that section); these details are important because they help you to determine the robot’s objectives.__

Chapters 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18 are what I call the “theory” chapters. Don’t let that word scare you, though. When I say theory chapters, __I simply mean that these chapters give you plenty(很多的東西) to think about—what does the robot need to do, what can it not do, what parts(零件) should be used, and what parts should not be used. '''I use the Design Journal page in these theory chapters, and I’ve provided five blank copies in the back of the book for you to follow along with me (or use them to develop your own robots; 照著作者做看看, 或許對解決問題很有幫助[...]).'''__

Chapters 3, 7, 11, 15, and 19 are the ''building instructions'' for the robots. In each chapter, you’ll find a set of photos that walks you through building my version of the robot. __You can follow my steps and build the exact same robots I include in the book, or you can come up with your own creations. (If you find you’re missing a part or something just doesn’t snap together properly, '''the best part about Lego robots is that there’s always a workaround—another way to connect something or a combination of parts that can be used as a substitute. Don’t stress about it—use your creativity and find an alternative solution!''')__

Chapters 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 provide the ''programming instructions''. I use plenty of screenshots to show you how to configure each block that is used in the NXT-G programming language. If you have used my building instructions, you can also use the programming instructions. These chapters also include instructions for you on how to set up a ''test environment'' for testing your robots and see if they can complete the challenges.

Finally, I’ve included some appendices for you; references, instructions for documenting your own robots, and other stuff. Check them out.

=== Who Is This Book For? ===

It doesn’t matter if you are 10 years old or 50, building robots is fun. This book is for everyone who wants to build some new Mindstorms NXT robots and have fun. I don’t expect you to be a programming guru—I’m certainly not. I also don’t expect you to have advanced degrees in robotics, engineering, or computer science. __'''Let’s all remember that Lego Mindstorms NXT is, ultimately, a Lego product. It’s a TOY! It’s supposed to be fun, not stressful.'''__

If you’re a kid, this book can be a great way to get your mom or dad interested in your hobby(嗜好). And if you’re a parent, this book can be a great way to have some fun with your kids. I think you’ll see that it’s fun to create challenges for yourself (or someone else) and then try to build some great robots to overcome those challenges.

=== What You Need to Use This Book ===

The only things you need besides this book are a Lego Mindstorms NXT robotics kit and a computer to run the software and upload programs to your robots. __'''There are currently two versions of the Mindstorms NXT kit—the retail version that you can buy online or in stores, and the education version that Lego sells to teachers, schools, and individuals. (雖然教育版比較貴, 但是零件並沒有含括所有零售版的部份)''' There are differences in the types of parts that come in the two kit versions, so please be aware that all the robots in this book have been built with the retail version. If you own the education version, that’s okay. It just means that if you find I’m using a part that you don’t have, you’ll have to improvise(即席創作). Don’t let that bother you—just look at it as another challenge to overcome and something new to learn.__

=== Day 2: King Ixtua Tomb Excavation, 4:42 PM ===

Evan leaned against(靠在) a large stone at the base of the pyramid(金字塔) and sprayed more insect repellent(殺蟲劑) on his left arm. The smell was horrible, but unlike the sunscreen(防曬油中的遮光劑), at least it worked. Evan wasn’t sure which was more burned, his nose or his ears. He couldn’t wait to get inside the pyramid and the shade it offered. The pyramid and the base camp(營地) were completely covered by the jungle and not visible from above, but the sunlight still managed to find its way through the leaves and branches and heat the air.

“A slight problem here,” said Uncle Phillip as he walked away from the large stone entry door to the Mayan tomb(墓穴). He continued walking across the camp, with his two assistants, Max and Grace, running to keep up(跟上).

Evan turned and ran to catch up(追上) with his uncle. “What’s wrong?” he asked, almost running into two Guatemalan(瓜地馬拉的) guides carrying a box of excavation(挖掘) equipment.

“Follow me, Evan, and I’ll show you,” Uncle Phillip replied as they continued walking towards the communications tent(帳篷).

Dr. Phillip Hicks was the lead excavator(開鑿者) for a newly discovered Mayan tomb, deep in the Guatemalan jungle. Evan’s uncle was a professor of archaeology(考古學) and taught at Florida(佛羅里達) State University, but he jumped at(搶著) any chance he could find to leave the classroom and do some hands-on(實地的) research. Two weeks ago Evan’s parents had received a call from Uncle Phillip, asking if Evan would like to tag along(尾隨); his parents had agreed to let him travel with his uncle for a few weeks to finish off his summer vacation. It would also be a nice break from Evan’s younger twin brothers, Les and Wes.

As they entered the communications tent, Uncle Phillip threw his FSU cap(佛羅里達州立大學的帽子) on a nearby chair. Sitting next to the chair was a large opened chest(櫃子) with numerous books and strange equipment. Uncle Phillip was an expert in Mayan history, and earlier in the day he had shown Evan a picture of a Mayan glyph(象形文字) from one of the books. Uncle Phillip told Evan that the strangely drawn symbol represented King Ixtua. That same symbol was carved(雕刻) in stone above the tomb’s entry door, confirming(證實) that the Mayan pyramid was the tomb of the ancient Mayan king.

Uncle Phillip began flipping(翻閱) maps on a large table, looking for something. “Where’s the enlargement(放大的照片) of the Tupaxu(金字塔的設計師) manuscript(手稿)? That drawing makes sense now,” he said.

One of the assistants, Max, was looking on a small side table. Evan stood quietly, not wanting to interfere. The other assistant, Grace, began to dig through the chest of books.

“Have you ever heard the story of King Ixtua, Evan?” asked Uncle Phillip. He continued to shuffle maps and papers on the table.

Evan shook(搖) his head. “No, sir. My history grades aren’t so hot. Sorry.”

“That’s okay,” replied Uncle Phillip. “I didn’t really become interested in history until college. But I think you’ll like this story.”

Evan’s last history grade had not been impressive; science and math were more to his liking. But when his uncle had told him that this pyramid was unopened and had been hidden for more than 700 years, __Evan couldn’t resist(抗拒). He had packed his clothes, MP3 player, laptop, and the new ''robotics kit'' his parents had given him for his birthday last month, and met his uncle at the airport. If the pyramid turned out to be one big boring rock, he’d have his music and could at least spend some time designing some robots to show his friends when he got home.__

“This King Ixtua liked monkeys, you see,” said Uncle Phillip as he continued to search through a smaller pile(堆) of maps and papers. “He had numerous http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_Monkey[spider monkeys(蜘蛛猴)] that he trained to do tricks(耍鬼把戲). The story tells us that King Ixtua had a pyramid built as his final resting place. To keep out tomb robbers(盜賊) and other unwelcome guests, he had the builders design the pyramid so only ''someone friendly to his monkeys'' could gain access to the tomb. A nice legend(傳說), huh?”

“Weird(怪異的),” Evan said, and then laughed. His uncle smiled at him and laughed, too.

“Here it is!” yelled Max, as he pulled a large sheet off the small table and walked over to Uncle Phillip. Evan watched as his uncle carefully placed the sheet in front of his team.

“Two years ago, Evan, one of my old professors found a Mayan manuscript in a sealed jar on a dig and gave it to me. I translated the writing and found it was written by Tupaxu, the king’s pyramid builder. It gave a general description of the location of the pyramid, among other things,” said Uncle Phillip. “Look at this,” said Uncle Phillip, pointing his finger at a strange drawing on the sheet.

{{attachment:figure_1-1.png}} <<BR>> Figure 1-1. Tunnel drawing

Evan looked at the small drawing. It was surrounded by the strange Mayan writing he had seen on the various ruins in the camp.

Evan shook his head. “What is it?” he asked.

Grace pointed at the strange writing. “It’s a drawing of a small tunnel. Your uncle was right about(忙於) the monkeys, it seems,” she said. “That drawing shows us how to unlock the stone entry doorway(出入口) to the tomb.”

Evan still didn’t understand, and he frowned(皺眉頭). “What are these symbols?” he asked, pointing at the small shapes.

__“Measurements,” answered his uncle. “These measurements translate to a tunnel entrance roughly eighteen inches high by eighteen inches wide. Too small for a person, but just the right size for a small spider monkey.” (也就是說, 只有機器人進得去)__

“But if you’ve found the door, why can’t you just drill through it or knock(拆除) it down?” asked Evan.

Uncle Phillip shook his head. “First, we don’t destroy or damage any ruins(遺蹟). And second, the door has a trap that is disabled by a ''pressure switch''. If the switch isn’t pressed, the trap, whatever it is, will go off(爆炸) if we open or tamper with(損害) the door. Tupaxu was a very smart designer.”

“So you just need to find this pressure switch and press it, right?” asked Evan.

“The first part is easy, Evan,” said Uncle Phillip. “We found the pressure switch, but it’s in a very bad location. Come on, I’ll show you.”

=== Tunnel Challenge ===

Evan pointed his flashlight(手電筒) down the tunnel. The bright beam(光束) ended about ten feet ahead where the tunnel turned to the left and continued.

{{attachment:figure_1-2.png}} <<BR>> Figure 1-2. Tunnel at tomb entry

__“According to the manuscript, the tunnel is about ten feet deep. It then goes left about six feet and then turns left again for another three feet. At the end of the tunnel is a small ''pressure plate(板塊)'',” said Uncle Phillip. “If the pressure plate isn’t triggered, we can’t get in.”__

Grace was busy taking measurements of the tunnel with a tape measure(皮尺). She nodded(點頭) and wrote in her notebook. “It definitely matches the dimensions of the drawing. It looks like you were right; a trained monkey would follow the path and step onto the pressure plate, triggering the release for the doorway,” she said. “The legend of King Ixtua is true.”

Uncle Philip shook his head. “Unfortunately, the story of the monkeys is also true. I don’t think we have any trained monkeys in our tents. And Evan may be too big to send down the tunnel,” he replied.

“What!” yelled Evan. “Are you serious?”

Uncle Phillip laughed. “Just kidding, Evan,” he said. “We’ll find another way.”

Evan watched his uncle scratch(搔頭) his head and turn to walk back to camp. It appeared that the exploration of the tomb was at a standstill(停頓). Evan felt sorry for his uncle and the assistants, knowing they had spent so much time planning this expedition(探險). It was hard to believe the solution to the problem was something as simple as a small monkey stepping on(踏上) a pressure plate.

Uncle Phillip, Grace, and Max talked quietly as they walked back to camp. Evan looked down the small tunnel and shook his head. If only we had a small trained monkey, he thought.

And then the idea came to him.

“Wait!” Evan yelled and then spun to face the others. “I’ve got it!”

=== Evan’s Solution ===

Back in the communications tent, Evan set(放置) a small, plastic yellow toolbox on the table. Next to it was his dad’s old laptop that was currently booting up. Evan opened the toolbox and reached in, pulling out a small rectangular object.

“This is the Mindstorms NXT Intelligent Brick,” he said. “This is the brains of any robot I build with this kit.” Evan handed it to his uncle and continued pulling out various objects. He watched as his uncle turned the Brick over in his hands and examined it closely.

“And these are sensors and other parts that are used to build a robot.” He set a few of the objects on the table in front of the team and then logged into the computer.

{{attachment:figure_1-3.png}} <<BR>> Figure 1-3.Mindstorms NXT Intelligent Brick and other components

Max and Grace each picked up some of the components and examined them, and Uncle Phillip handed the Brick back to Evan. Evan set the Brick on the table and pointed at the computer screen.

“This software allows me to program the robot to do various tasks. I can tweak the software until I get the robot to do exactly what I want it to do. Pretty cool, isn’t it?” he asked.

Uncle Phillip smiled and nodded. “Are you telling me that you can build a small robot with this stuff that can go down that tunnel and trigger the pressure plate?”

Evan smiled. “Yep. And I don’t think it will take me that long, either,” he replied. He pulled out a small brown notebook from the laptop case and opened it up. He had been playing with the Mindstorms NXT kit for about a month and had plenty of notes and comments written in it.

Max handed his component to Evan and pointed at it. “What does that do?” he asked.

“That’s a servo motor. It does a lot of different things, but I use it mainly to give a robot wheels to move. Grace is holding the sound sensor,” Evan said, pointing at a small block that Grace was examining.

Uncle Phillip pulled a chair over to the table and sat down with Evan. He looked over all the parts Evan was placing on the table and nodded.

“This might work,” Uncle Phillip said. “How much time do you think you’ll need?”

__“Well, I’ll need to do some ''planning'' first, mainly to ''figure out the best parts to use''. The actual building and programming will take some time, too.__ I’m guessing three or four hours,” Evan replied.

Max and Grace looked at Professor Hicks, waiting for his decision.

Evan’s uncle looked at his watch. “It’s almost dinner time, and the sun will be down in a few hours. There’s really no point in trying to open the tomb tonight. If you can get the robot working, we’ll let you send it down the tunnel tomorrow,” he said. “Is there anything else you need, Evan?”

Evan thought for a moment, looking at the robotics kit in front of him and all the components.

“I just need some time to work through my design notebook. I’ll start building and programming after dinner,” he said. “This’ll be fun.”

Uncle Phillip smiled at Evan. “All right, this sounds like a good plan,” he said, and stood up. “Dinner is in 40 minutes.”

Evan watched as Uncle Phillip, Grace, and Max left the tent, and then he took a deep breath. “Time to get started,” he said.

Story continues in Chapter 5 . . .

== Chapter 2: ExploroBot — Planning and Design ==

In this chapter you’re going to learn (drum-roll, please—cue(插入台詞) the announcer(播音員)) . . . A PLANNING AND DESIGN PROCESS!

Please don’t let the words scare you. Yes, “planning and design process” sounds boring, but I promise that you’ll have fun with this chapter. __I know you’re ready to start putting pieces together to build a bot, but if you take some time and go through these P&D chapters, you’ll be building and programming your own robots in less time, with fewer mistakes.__

So, let’s get started. That tomb door is still locked, and you’re going to need the ExploroBot to open it.

=== The ExploroBot ===

Do you have a picture of the ExploroBot in your mind already? If so, I’ll bet that it doesn’t look exactly like the one pictured here (see Figure 2-1). (If it does, you are an amazing mind reader. Call me—we can make a fortune on the stock market.)

Note: There are five blank design journal pages in the back of this book that you can cut out. You're going to use them to design the robots in this book and robots of your own. If you need more pages, you can find a file titled `DesignJournal.pdf` in the Source Code/Download area of the Apress Web site (http://www.apress.com) that you can use to print more pages.

At the top of the design journal page you’ll see the words Robot Name. __Go ahead and write ExploroBot in the box (這種駱駝文的命名方式跟 Robocode 很像), and pat yourself on the back(自滿).__ The PLANNING AND DESIGN PROCESS has begun. (You could write something else, such as RobotThatOpensTombDoors, but you might run out of space.)

{{attachment:figure_2-1.png}} <<BR>> Figure 2-1. The ExploroBot

Are you wondering how that little robot is going to open the tomb door? Good question. And you’re going to answer that question by following along using a page out of Evan’s design journal.

=== The Robot Description ===

Okay, now that you’ve named your robot, it’s time to describe it. No, I’m not talking about “Short, grey and white, with wheels.” What I mean is, what is this robot supposed to do? At this point, I hope you’ve read Chapter 1. If not, I’ll wait . . . Go back and read it. Okay, have you finished it? Good. Now, what is this robot supposed to do? Don’t say it, write it.

Look on your design journal page, and you’ll see Robot Description and a large blank box. __Don’t be shy here. This is where you’re going to try your hardest to describe ''accurately'' what this robot will do for you. (任務說明) Look back to Figure 1-2 in Chapter 1 if you need a reminder about the path the robot needs to follow.__ Let me show you what I wrote down, and you can compare it to your description, okay? Here goes (see Figure 2-2).

{{attachment:figure_2-2.png}} <<BR>> Figure 2-2. Robot description

If your description isn’t exactly like mine, that’s okay. __What is important is that you got the ''major points'': Robot moves forward about ten feet, stops, turns. Robot moves six feet, stops, turns. And on and on. Trust me—without an accurate description of the robot, it will be more difficult to build (Chapter 3) and program (Chapter 4).__ Don’t worry if your description missed something; you’ll get better at this, I promise. You’re going to have more opportunities to write robot descriptions later in the book. By the time you’re finished, you’ll be an expert.

__So, what’s next, you ask? Okay, I’ll tell you—you’re going to take the description you wrote and ''break it down into small, single-item tasks.''(各個擊破)__

=== The Task List ===

On your design journal page, locate the Task List section. This section is where you’re going to list each individual task that the robot must perform. The good news is that if you wrote down a detailed description (see the previous section), then this section is almost already done.

What do I mean by “individual task?” __An ''individual task'' is something like “Walk forward five feet” or “Turn doorknob(門把).” Something like “Press the button and turn the wheel” is not an individual task. Your goal is to list the actions your robot will perform, one at a time. '''(這跟 LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT-G Programming Guide 一書中 "When writing pseudo-code, break down your instructions into short and simple statements for your robot" 的說法是一致的)'''__ Take a look at my task list (see Figure 2-3).

{{attachment:figure_2-3.png}} <<BR>> Figure 2-3. The ExploroBot task list

Compare your task list to mine. Were you able to break down the robot description into individual tasks? These individual tasks will help you in many ways, including assembling(組裝) the correct form for your bot, picking the appropriate sensors to be used, and later when programming the bot.

I’ll give you a small preview of how we’ll use the task list later. __Look at steps 2, 5, 8, 12, and 15—“Stop before hitting wall.” Are you already thinking about how to do this? You’ve got options, of course. There’s the Touch sensor that can be programmed to stop the robot when it’s triggered. And what about the Ultrasonic sensor? The sensor sends out a signal that’s detected when it bounces back off an object in front of it, such as our wall. '''So you can see that this task list will help you to start thinking about the NXT components you’ll use.'''__ For now, let’s leave the Task List and move on to the next section of the Design Journal.

=== Limitations and Constraints ===

You’re going to encounter one obstacle(障礙) quickly when you begin to design your robots using the Lego Mindstorms NXT kit. What is it? It’s the number of parts in your kit.

__It would be nice if you had access to an unlimited number of sensors, motors, connectors, beams(桁條), and other components. But for this book, and the robot designs included in it, I’m not making any assumptions about your collection of parts except that you have the Lego Mindstorms NXT kit or the Lego Mindstorms Education NXT version of the kit.__

When you begin to design your robots, you need to be aware of ''limitations'' (or ''constraints'') such as this one. Limitations and/or constraints can come from many different places. Besides the number of parts in your robotics kit, you need to keep in mind things such as the following:

 * Robot size and weight (tall, short, heavy, light, wide, thin, square, circular)
 * Weather and lighting conditions (outdoors, indoors, artificial light, no light)
 * Floor or surface conditions (soft, hard, wet, slippery(滑溜的), and so on)
 * Movement requirements (up, down, left, right, forward, backward, diagonal(對角的))
 
__'''There may be some constraints that you won’t encounter until you begin building and testing your robots. Don’t worry if this happens. Your main goal at this point should be to write down any limitations that come immediately to mind. (對環境的觀察也是很重要)''' Just look back at your Robot Description and Task List and the environment or objects where the robot will interact.__ Do any constraints come to mind? Write them down on your Design Journal page in the Limitations/ Constraints area.

Take a look at Figure 2-4. I’ve written down a few sentences that describe what I think are some major constraints for the ExploroBot. Remember, there may be other constraints that won’t show up until we begin testing our design. The important part is to try and identify any obvious constraints before you begin to design and build your bot.

{{attachment:figure_2-4.png}} <<BR>> Figure 2-4. The ExploroBot has a few constraints to consider.

The constraints for the ExploroBot aren’t too difficult to work around. Let’s take a look at the challenge and see how these constraints will ''affect the robot design''.

First, the robot will enter a tunnel that has a fixed height and width. So the robot you build cannot be too wide or too tall or it simply won’t fit into the tunnel. We know the measurement of the tunnel is 18 inches tall and 18 inches wide. We’ll keep that in mind when we begin to design.

The second constraint is a little trickier(狡猾地). Take a look at Figure 2-5. This is an overhead view of the tunnel and its dimensions. Pay attention to the two corners where the robot will turn.

{{attachment:figure_2-5.png}} <<BR>> Figure 2-5. The ExploroBot has to turn a few corners to land on the trigger.

__The robot must stop before it hits the wall at Corner 1. When it stops, it will turn left and proceed to Corner 2. '''When it’s turning, we’ll have to be careful to give the robot sufficient space to turn and not bump into the wall.'''__ There are numerous methods for building and programming a robot to make a ''right-angle turn'', and I encourage you to experiment with other methods.

So, how will we do this right-angle (or 90 degree) turn and give the robot plenty of room to avoid bumping the walls? Glad you asked.

If you look at Figure 2-6, you’ll notice I’ve zoomed in on the first corner and included some measurements, including the length and width of the ExploroBot. Ideally, we would like the robot to stop a certain distance from the wall and turn left, and the best place for the robot to stop would be directly in the middle of the corner. I don’t want this to get too complicated, so just keep in mind that when the robot turns, it cannot be too close to the wall or, when it turns, it will bump the wall with its front right wheel. __So be aware that during the building and programming of the ExploroBot, we’ll be “tinkering(修補)” and “tweaking” to get the bot to perform well in a corner.__

Note: During the building and programming of the bot, you’ll perform many tests. During this phase, you’ll test many of the bot’s functions—forward speed, stopping speed, detecting the wall, stopping at a proper distance, and more. I’ll cover this in more detail in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4.

__The final constraint isn’t so much a constraint as it is a ''condition'' that might affect the bot. The surface of the tunnel is stone. It’s a flat rough surface, not made of sand. '''I’m including this constraint only to demonstrate that you must always be aware of the ''external conditions'' the robot will face.''' Because the surface is flat and rough, we should be able to use the large rubber wheels to move the robot, because they’ll have a good grip(抓牢) on the surface of the tunnel.__ But this might not always be possible. A wet surface can sometimes cause plastic or thin wheels to simply spin without getting traction(牽引), keeping the robot from moving. And what if the robot doesn’t have a surface to roll or walk across? I’ll answer that question in Chapter 6.

__Just try and always keep an open mind when thinking about the obstacles your robot will face. Examine the robot’s environment, its tasks, and its overall goal as you start to brainstorm about how you’ll solve the problem.__ And that’s what you’re going to do next. You’re going to brainstorm about this bot’s design, components, and overall appearance in this next Design Journal section—Mindstorm.

=== Mindstorm ===

Convenient name for this section, huh? The Lego Mindstorms NXT robotics kit uses that unique word, Mindstorms. __For us, to mindstorm (or brainstorm) is our chance to use our ''creativity'' and start developing ''ideas'' for how this bot will be designed and built. This is an easy section to complete. What I want you to do is simply write down your questions, observations, and ideas that have been popping into your head since you became aware of the challenge. There are no incorrect items to place in this section except for sketches—those come last.__ So, to get you started, take a look at Figure 2-7. You’ll see some of my initial thoughts on this challenge, this bot, and the direction I want to take for my initial design.

{{attachment:figure_2-7.png}} <<BR>> Figure 2-7. The Mindstorm section contains my initial thoughts.

I’m not going to cover all my Mindstorm items here, but I would like to mention a couple and explain how and why I wrote them.

__One of my observations was “For the bot to turn, it will require at least 2 motors.” '''This might seem like common sense, but then again, maybe not. (做法有很多種)''' In order for a bot to turn, it has to have a force that makes it turn. Two wheels, connected to a single motor, only give forward and backward motion. For the bot to turn left and right, it requires another motor.__ By spinning one motor (and its wheel) in one direction and spinning the other motor in the reverse direction, we can cause the bot to turn. This can also be accomplished simply by locking the second motor in place and keeping it from spinning. One wheel will spin, the other wheel will not spin, and the bot will turn.

Another observation was “Sound-control would require Sound sensor and add complexity— should avoid it.” One of my initial ideas was to control the bot by using different sounds and tones. One tone would stop the bot, another tone would make it turn right, and yet another would make it turn left. Then it occurred to me that this would be just too much trouble. My goal is to make the bot ''as independent as possible'' and allow it to find its way down the tunnel ''and back'' (還要回到起點的挑戰比較大...). So the Sound sensor was eliminated.

Your main objective here is simply to have some fun and write down some of your initial thoughts on what you’d like to do with your bot design. __You might have to take a completely different direction after some testing. You might find you exhaust(用完) your supply of a particular component. '''What you write down isn’t going to lock you in to a particular design. (這就是為何要寫下 "what parts should not be used" 的原因, 避免在設計的過程中誤踩地雷...)''' You can change the design anytime—even start over completely.__ Print out another Design Journal page and try a different design. It’s supposed to be fun, so make it fun. Go crazy with your ideas—the crazier, the better!

Now you’re done with the Robot Description and the Task List is full. You’ve identified some Limitations/Constraints and your Mindstorm items section is overflowing with your thoughts and observations. It’s now time to finish up with the Design Journal’s final section—Sketches.

=== Sketches ===

When I draw stick figure(人或動物等的略圖) people, they tend to have very short legs and very long arms. I still color outside the lines with crayons. I guess what I’m trying to say is that if you’re a professional artist, you don’t have to worry about any competition from me.

I can, however, draw shapes that are fairly close to squares, circles, rectangles, and triangles. And that’s good enough for what I’m going to ask you to do in this section. I want to give you some suggestions before starting on the building of your bot, and I’m going to take my own advice and show you my actual sketches for the ExploroBot.

__I’m going to reference some of the ideas I wrote down in the Mindstorm section and show you how I came up with the size and shape of the ExploroBot. '''First, I’ll start with the shape.''' Take a look at Figure 2-8 and notice that I started with a basic shape to help determine the placement of sensors, motors, and other parts.__

{{attachment:figure_2-8.png}} <<BR>> Figure 2-8. In the Sketches section, try and start with placing basic shapes.

First, I need to decide between the Touch sensor or the Ultrasonic sensor for detecting an approaching wall or obstacle. If I use the Touch sensor, it will need to be placed far in front of the bot, possibly on a long neck or pole(桿), to allow it time to stop the bot and give it room to turn. __But if I use the Ultrasonic sensor I can place it closer to the bot’s body because it can detect a wall or an obstacle from a distance and it doesn’t require an impact(碰撞) with the wall or obstacle. Because my goal is to keep the ExploroBot as short in length as possible, I’m going to use the Ultrasonic sensor. (這中間 "決策能力" 的訓練很重要)__

My ExploroBot will require two motors (for turning), the Ultrasonic sensor, and the Intelligent Brick. And unless I want the Brick to scrape(刮) the ground while it moves, I’ll need to give it one or two extra wheels. I’ll try to save some weight and keep the size down by using three wheels.

__What I’m envisioning(想像) is using the Intelligent Brick as the main body. Two motors, one on each side of the Brick, will spin the two wheels used for forward and backward motion and for turning. '''I’ll configure a small third wheel that will pivot(在樞軸上轉動) to make the bot’s turning a little smoother and give less resistance(阻力).'''__

What do your sketches look like? Have you taken a different approach to the design of the ExploroBot? __Remember, there is no right or wrong solution. If your ExploroBot reaches the end of the tunnel, lands on the pressure plate, and then ''returns to the tunnel entrance'', you’ve succeeded in opening the tomb door.__

In Chapter 3 I’m going to walk you through the assembly of my version of the ExploroBot. Feel free to change it up! Move the Ultrasonic sensor to the back or simply change it to the Touch sensor. Try giving it four wheels instead of three. (四輪的控制更難) Chapter 4 will show you how to program the ExploroBot; at the end of the chapter I’ll also give you some ideas on how to ''set up the challenge'' and test your bot.

Now, let’s build the ExploroBot!

== Chapter 3: ExploroBot—Build It ==

Before you begin building the ExploroBot, take a look at Figure 3-1. Remember, this is just one possible version of the ExploroBot. Some of you might choose to design and build your own version without going through this chapter, but for those who would like to build the one pictured, I have a few suggestions.

{{attachment:figure_3-1.png}} <<BR>> Figure 3-1. Evan’s version of the ExploroBot

=== Never Be Afraid to Experiment ===

I’ve chosen to include actual pictures of the construction of the ExploroBot. I’ve tried to provide enough detail in each figure for you to discern what parts are used and where those parts are placed. If you find that what you’re holding in your hands doesn’t quite look like the picture, do the following:

 1. Take a deep breath.
 2. Remember this is supposed to be fun.
 3. Go back to the previous step and confirm you’ve made it that far.
 4. Look at the current step, and examine the figure’s details for clues to where components should be placed. Things like counting holes to determine where two or more parts connect is useful. So is skipping ahead a few figures to try and see the parts from another angle.
 5. When in doubt, take your best guess and move forward.

If you do hit a roadblock and just can’t figure out how to move forward, try taking a look at the next few steps. Sometimes another figure will show the ExploroBot from a different angle and you’ll see the solution. Enjoy the building process and realize that if your final bot doesn’t look exactly like the one in this chapter, that’s okay. Remember: getting the bot to work and solving the challenge is your main goal.

Note: If you modify or try to create your own version of the ExploroBot (or any other bot in this book), please take a picture and e-mail it to me. I would enjoy seeing your final bot in action. I’ve included my e-mail address in the Introduction.

And now, on to the construction of the ExploroBot!

=== Step by Step ===

I’m going to break the ExploroBot into four sections. The first section will be the Ultrasonic Sensor and the “neck” used to support it. The second section will be the body, including the two motors and two wheels. The third section will be the rear-wheel assembly and the frame used to keep the cables tidy. You’ll finally assemble the ExploroBot in the fourth section using the head/neck, body/motors, and frame/rear-wheel subcomponents.

For each section, I’m simply going to jump from figure to figure. I’ll make comments where I feel a tricky area might exist or where I feel you need to be made aware of a special assembly instruction.

Pay special attention to those figures showing the individual parts lying unassembled. These will help you to determine what parts to locate for upcoming assembly figures. 

Here we go . . .

==== First Section:Ultrasonic Sensor and Neck ====

Starting with Figure 3-2 and continuing through Figure 3-9, you’ll be assembling the Exploro- Bot’s head and neck. Take a look at Figure 3-2 and Figure 3-4. These are the figures that show the majority of the parts you’ll be using in this section.

{{attachment:figure_3-2.png}} <<BR>> Figure 3-2. These are the parts you’ll need for the ExploroBot’s head.
{{attachment:figure_3-3.png}} <<BR>> Figure 3-3. The fully assembled ExploroBot head—set this aside for now
{{attachment:figure_3-4.png}} <<BR>> Figure 3-4. Parts for the left and right sides of the neck that will hold the ExploroBot’s head
{{attachment:figure_3-5.png}} <<BR>> Figure 3-5. Partial assembly of the left and right sides of the neck
{{attachment:figure_3-6.png}} <<BR>> Figure 3-6. Place the L-shaped beams. 
{{attachment:figure_3-7.png}} <<BR>> Figure 3-7. The fully assembled left and right sides of the neck
{{attachment:figure_3-8.png}} <<BR>> Figure 3-8. The left and right sides of the neck, ExploroBot’s head, and four round connecting pins

Note: What I call a “round connecting pin” is also called by its official Lego name: Part # 3713 Technic Bush. Why do I tell you this? Because I want you to be aware that Lego gives a unique part number to every component it sells. Also, because this is where I tell you that I’m going to avoid using the official part numbers unless absolutely necessary. If you’re unable to determine the identity of a component from a figure, take a look at the next figure or two. You’ll most likely be able to determine what the component is by seeing it from a different angle or by seeing it where it’s placed.

{{attachment:figure_3-9.png}} <<BR>> Figure 3-9. The fully assembled ExploroBot head and neck—set this aside for now.

It’s time for a quick check here. Take a look at your ExploroBot head and neck. Does it look like the one shown in Figure 3-9? If not, try and identify where the difference is and go back to the figures showing the assembly. If the difference is extremely obvious, spend a few minutes looking at the parts and you’ll find the mistake. When working with such small parts, it’s not uncommon to connect a part in reverse or upside down—I do it all the time.

When you’re satisfied with the ExploroBot head and neck assembly, set it aside for now. We’ll come back to it after you’ve completed the main body and rear-wheel sections.
