=== About ===

__NXT_Python is a package for controlling a LEGO NXT robot using the Python programming language. It can communicate using either USB or Bluetooth.__ It is available under the Free Software Foundation's GPL license. It was developed on Fedora Core (Linux), but it has been reported to work on Windows XP and Mac OS X as well. Here's a sample program:

 {{{
#!/usr/bin/env python

import nxt.locator

sock = nxt.locator.find_one_brick()
if sock:
	brick = sock.connect()
	name, host, signal_strength, user_flash = brick.get_device_info()
	print 'NXT brick name: %s' % name
	print 'Host address: %s' % host
	print 'Bluetooth signal strength: %s' % signal_strength
	print 'Free user flash: %s' % user_flash
	sock.close()
 }}}

=== Requirements ===

 * Python 2.4
 * For Bluetooth communication:
   * http://org.csail.mit.edu/pybluez/[PyBluez] (Linux or Windows)
   * http://www.cs.wlu.edu/~levy/software/nxt_lightblue_glue/[NXT Python Lightblue Glue] (Mac OS X)
 * For USB communication: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/[PyUSB]

=== Installation ===

這與 leJOS 內附文件 `README.html` 的做法完全一樣:

 * Untar/unzip source package

 * In package directory, run "python setup.py install" (as root)

 * For USB on Linux:

   * Create "lego" group, and make your user-id a member

   * Open a terminal as root, and type:

     {{{
groupadd lego
usermod -a -G lego [user-id]
     }}}

   * Create a udev rule. Create file at `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules`, containing one line:

     {{{
BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0694", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"
     }}}
