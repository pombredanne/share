How to get started with Linux Bluetooth and the NXT:

   Assumptions:
   1) You have a bluetooth adapter.
   2) You already have a kernel with the bluez modules loaded. (I use
   debian 2.4.27)
   3) You've installed bluez-utils
   * There are already many documents available on how to do these tasks.
   Okay, there are some tools you need to familiarize yourself with:
   hciconfig - displays status information on your bluetooth interface
   (similar to ifconfig)
   hcitool - used to query all kinds of information about bluetooth
   devices in your piconet
   sdptool - used to create and query "service description protocol"
   bluetooth services, like SP=serial port
   rfcomm - establishes connections to remote bluetooth services or
   listens for incomming service connections

Testing out Your Bluetooth Connection:

   You will first need to get your bluez daemons running.
   On debian, this looks like:
   /etc/init.d/bluez-utils start
   On Gentoo, I think it's
   /etc/init.d/bluetooth start
   Check that your connection is working:
   hciconfig hci0
   You should see something like:
   hci0: Type: USB
   BD Address: 00:0E:A1:31:57:48 ACL MTU: 377:10 SCO MTU: 16:0
   UP RUNNING PSCAN ISCAN
   RX bytes:15156 acl:468 sco:0 events:799 errors:0
   TX bytes:11447 acl:450 sco:0 commands:198 errors:0
   Hint: I have an AmbiCom USB bluetooth adapter. For whatever reason I
   need to issue the following command to get it started:
   hciconfig hci0 reset
   So, now, make sure your NXT is on,
   make sure bluetooth on the NXT is on,
   cross your fingers,
   and then type:
   hcitool scan
   If everything went to plan, you should see:
   Scanning ...

   Good. Now you can use the Nxt.pm module!
   Download the Nxt Perl API: Download
   Try to run the included test program:
   tar xvzf LEGO-NXT-1.41.tar.gz
   cd LEGO-NXT-1.41
   perl test.pl <xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx>
   You should hear your NXT make a chirping sound. :)

   Hi Michael, I finally tried this and I got as far as that it connects,
   and then the NXT shows in its display: Passkey: 1234_ 3 2 1 [v] a b c I
   tried entering the passkey of /etc/bluetooth/bin , but this does not
   make sense as we are connecting from the PC to the nxt. Perhaps the
   latest NXT firmware (1.0.3) introduced this feature? I looked through
   Net::Bluetooth trying to figure out how to set the pin, but I didn't
   find anything. Any clues?
   #1 Anonymous on 2006-10-18 22:12
   Hmmm... I think you may need to tweak your /etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf
   file. I included mine below. You should also have the script:
   /usr/bin/bluez-pin I believe this is included with the bluez-utils
   package. You should set your pin in the file: /usr/bluetooth/pin You
   referenced: /usr/bluetooth/bin, not sure if that is what you meant. The
   nxt defaults to pw 1234 and I have the same value in the
   "/usr/bluetooth/pin" file, just plain text "1234". Dont tell anyone,
   but I have the same combination on my luggage. ;) You know, I goofed
   around with the rfcomm utils for quite a while before I got the
   connection to work properly, but I can't remember exactly how I got the
   devices paired. If this doesn't work, I'd recommend doing the same (ie
   hacking) - I first paired my nxt to my PC using the rfcomm utils to get
   things working - perhaps this strategy would help. If you have detailed
   hints for others, please post them back here. Also feel free to email
   me if you run into trouble! Michael # HCId options options { #

   I finally figure out what went wrong. I had not commented out the
   dbus_pin_helper in the HCId options file. Just doing tail -f on
   /var/log/messages actually showed me that. So now I can finally speak
   to the NXT. I tried the UltraSound program and was surprised how slow
   the sampling was. I guess the next step is trying to figure out how to
   upload programs and then how to send bluetooth messages to the program.
   Thanks, Dov
   #1.1.1 Dov Grobgeld on 2006-10-19 19:05
   Yes, you are correct. Sampling ultrasound over bluetooth is extremely
   slow. I actually am not using the BT functionality much anymore for
   that reason. I've decided to go all-USB instead. My rig actually mounts
   an ultra-light laptop on a Lego chassis with the NXT and controlls the
   NXT via USB. That way I can get 802.11, full linux functionality, and
   usb controlled motion and sensor gathering all in one unit. It's not
   light or fast on wheels, but it works and provides me with all the
   platform functionality I want.
