Setting up NXT-Bluetooth support on Linux

   So you want your NXT device to talk back to your Linux machine? Perhaps
   you want to control your robot through your computer. As a first step,
   you have to set up the Linux - NXT bluetooth connection. My setup is
   explained below.
     * Ubuntu Gutsy (7.10) Linux, though these instructions are not
       version dependant. The only instructions that depend on the
       distribution are the ones related to package installation
       (apt-get). If you know your distribution's package manager, you
       should have no trouble.
     * An x86 computer. Typically, you'll want a laptop with bluetooth
       support, so you can walk around with your NXT construction. A
       desktop will do just fine too. You need an x86 because the nbc
       binary only works on an x86.
     * A Lego Mindstorm NXT.
     * Bluetooth hardware on your linux machine.
     * The Linux packages: bluez-utils, python-bluez, bluez-hcidump,
       bluez-gnome, bluetooth

   Make sure you have all the packages installed. On Ubuntu, you can run
   this command.
sudo apt-get install bluez-utils python-bluez bluez-hcidump bluez-gnome bluetoot
h

   Now, once all the packages are installed, make sure that your bluetooth
   hardware is supported and is running fine. One way to do this is to
   check for the bluetooth icon in the taskbar of Gnome.
     * [icon.png]

   You should be able to click on that icon and get a list of preferences.
   In case you are not sure if you device is getting recognized and used,
   check for lines similar to the ones below in the output of dmesg
[243203.060226] Bluetooth: HCI USB driver ver 2.9
[243203.063512] usbcore: registered new interface driver hci_usb

   Now that you have a working bluetooth setup, you need to pair it with
   the NXT brick. First, you need to ensure that the serial service is
   started by selecting it in the preferences dialog from the bluetooth
   icon.
     * [serialStarted.png]

   Now turn on your NXT Brick, and enter bluetooth settings, and turn
   bluetooth on. You can verify that bluetooth is turned on by looking in
   the top left of the NXT display. It should have a bluetooth icon. Now
   run the command sudo hcitool scan from a console. The output should
   contain a line for your NXT device. My device is called Snow, and I get
   the following output.
Scanning ...
        11:22:33:44:55:66       Snow

   Great!. This is definite proof that your bluetooth device works, and
   that it can see your NXT. Time to set them up for pairing. Edit the
   file /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf to contain the following block:
rfcomm0 {
        # Automatically bind the device at startup
        bind yes;

        # Bluetooth address of the device
        device 11:22:33:44:55:66;

        # RFCOMM channel for the connection
        channel 1;

        # Description of the connection
        comment "Snow Mindstorm";
}

   Change the address 11:22:33:44:55:66 to match the output of your
   hcitool scan command that you made in the previous step. Now run the
   command sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart, and then rfcomm. The output
   should contain your device's address. A sample session is shown here:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart
   * Restarting bluetooth            [ OK ]
$ rfcomm
rfcomm0: 11:22:33:44:55:66 channel 1 clean

   Now, you need to pair your device. This is done with the following
   command
$ sudo l2ping 11:22:33:44:55:66

   This will prompt the NXT to beep happily, asking for a passphrase. The
   number "1234" is already entered, so just accept it by pressing the
   orange button. Now your computer will want to know this passphrase.
   Click on the button in the notification that pops up (example shown
   below), and enter the same number as shown. This is a one-time
   procedure for each computer-NXT combination.
     * [request.png]
     * Enter the passphrase

   If you have a multi-seat (or multi-terminal) setup, this notification
   might be going to another seat, so check all notification areas on
   every terminal. If you don't know what multi-seat or multi-terminal
   setup is, ignore the previous statement. If all went well, your ping
   command should be able to send packets back and forth to the NXT. A
   happy sample output is shown below.
Ping: 11:22:33:44:55:66 from 00:09:DD:50:67:CE (data size 44) ...
4 bytes from 11:22:33:44:55:66 id 0 time 49.95ms
4 bytes from 11:22:33:44:55:66 id 1 time 85.71ms
4 bytes from 11:22:33:44:55:66 id 2 time 27.80ms
4 bytes from 11:22:33:44:55:66 id 3 time 54.80ms
4 bytes from 11:22:33:44:55:66 id 4 time 65.81ms
4 bytes from 11:22:33:44:55:66 id 5 time 47.80ms
4 bytes from 11:22:33:44:55:66 id 6 time 84.79ms
4 bytes from 11:22:33:44:55:66 id 7 time 45.81ms

   Great! So now your NXT is paired with the computer. In order to
   communicate with the desktop, you need to download the NXT Python
   library. Once you have downloaded and installed it, enter the sample
   program, and you should be able to get the NXT's name and ID. If you
   have any problems at this stage, try rebooting the NXT brick, it
   sometimes helps. After running the sample program, you should see your
   hostname in the "My Contacts" in the NXT's bluetooth menu. This
   verifies that you can connect with the NXT, and have the NXT talk back
   to the desktop computer.
