How to play with Bluetooth under Linux

   This is a starter for Bluetooth on Linux. Things are still a little in
   flux so it may work somewhat differently for you.

   Have a program ready on the NXT that sends some data via Bluetooth.

   Install bluez-utils and a recent kernel with Bluetooth enabled. (I have
   Debian with kernel 2.6.17.6 and bluez-utils 3.1 .)

   Plug in your Bluetooth dongle (any recent one should do).

   Then look at the manpages and play a little with the commands hcitool,
   sdptool and rfcomm.

   To receive data from an NXT do the following:

   sdptool add --channel=3 SP

   This announces the Serial Port service, hence SP. It may already be
   done by your system, you can check with sdptool browse local. You may
   also leave out the --channel option, the default channel is one.

   rfcomm listen /dev/rfcomm0 3

   This listens on RFCOMM channel three, when the connection is
   established the device /dev/rfcomm0 will be created and data will
   arrive there.

   On the NXT connect to your host. A sore point is the entry of the pin
   on the Linux host, for me it is in the file /etc/bluetooth/pin. A "line
   is busy" message on the NXT can mean anything, e.g. if you forgot one
   of the commands above.

   On another terminal do something like

   cat /dev/rfcomm0 | od -t x1 -w1 -v -Ax

   start the program on the NXT and watch the data arrive. I had a small
   program that sent "good job", this is the output I got:

000001 80
