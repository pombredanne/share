** Tynker is a new computing platform designed specifically to teach children computational thinking and programming skills in a fun and imaginative way. The cloud hosted system is now available to teachers, schools and districts. 
** Tynker for home use coming soon! 父母親也可以是老師，申請時的角色可以是 Parent/Homeschooler
** Tynker is device independent, browser based, with zero install. You can sign-up, add students and set up a classroom in minutes.
** Kids animate drawings, create music, build games, craft e-books, publish mobile games and more, all while building computational skills. Learning is intuitive and interactive, as visual drag-n-drop coding eliminates syntax. 跟 Alice 很像
** Tynker is the platform of choice at many noted schools. Educators believe Tynker is the ideal platform to teach programming and enhance the learning of concepts in math, science and other subjects. 目的不是要寫程式，而是訓練邏輯思考
** Flexibly integrate Tynker into your school curriculum. Full featured visual programming environment, built-in tutor, classroom management, student assessment and lesson plans for all grades make Tynker a complete solution for educators. 搞不好可以用來弄個教學!!
** Tynker unlocks STEM skills. Computer programming develops the same skills that help students succeed in science, technology, math and engineering (這四項就是所謂的 STEM) - Logical, linear thinking; planning & organizing, problem solving, modeling and more.
