== Installing Guest Operating Systems ==

The Guest Operating System Installation Guide includes installation instructions for installing supported guest operating systems on the following VMware products:

 * VMware ESX Server 2.0 and later
 * VMware ESXi/ESX 3.5 and later
 * VMware Workstation 4.0 and later
 * VMware Server 1.0 and later
 * VMware Fusion1.0 and later
 * VMware ACE 1.0 and later
 * VMware GSX Server 3.0 and later

If you are using VMware® Workstation 3.x, VMware GSX Server 2.x, VMware ESX Server 1.x or an earlier VMware product, see the user’s manual that came with your product for installation instructions for the guest operating systems supported by that product.

Operating systems that are not included in this guide are not supported.

See “General Installation Instructions for All VMware Products” on page 12 for information that might apply to the guest you are installing and see “Latest Updates” on page 11 for the most recent changes to this guide.

=== Latest Updates ===

:::

=== CentOS 5.0 ===

Be sure to read “General Installation Instructions for All VMware Products” on page 12 and this section before installing this operating system.

The easiest method of installing CentOS 5.0 in a virtual machine is to use the standard CentOS distribution CD. Installing CentOS 5.0 via the boot floppy/network method is also supported. __If your VMware product supports it, you can also install from a PXE server.__

Fulfill these prerequisites before installing CentOS 5.0:

 * Create and configure a new virtual machine.

Consider these support and configuration issues for CentOS 5.0:

 * __Select Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 64‐bit for the guest operating system when creating the virtual machine. CentOS 5 is not listed as an option.__

 * __Configure the virtual machine with a minimum of 512MB of memory.__ If the virtual machine has less than 512MB of memory, CentOS 5.0 displays an error message as it loads certain VMware drivers.

 * __Use the LSI Logic SCSI adapter. CentOS 5.0 does not include a driver for the BusLogic SCSI adapter.__

 * On a Linux host with an XFree86 3.x X server, do not run a screen saver in the guest operating system.
Guest screen savers that demand a lot of processing power can cause the X server on the host to freeze.

'''Installation Steps'''

 1. Insert the CentOS 5.0 CD‐ROM in the CD‐ROM drive.

 2. Power on the virtual machine to start installing CentOS 5.0.

 3 Follow the installation steps as you would for a physical machine. Be sure to make the choices outlined in the following steps.

 4. __Do not select the Virtualization Option during the installation. Refer to knowledge base article 9134325 at http://kb.vmware.com/kb/9134325 for more information.__

 5. Allow automatic partitioning of the disk to occur in the Automatic Partitioning screen or partition the virtual disk manually if you do not want to use the CentOS defaults. <<BR>> You might see a warning that begins “The partition table on device <devicename> was unreadable. To create new partitions it must be initialized, causing the loss of ALL DATA on the drive.” This does not mean that anything is wrong with the hard drive on your physical computer. It simply means that the virtual hard drive in your virtual machine needs to be partitioned and formatted.

 6. Click Yes to partition the drive.

This completes basic installation of the CentOS 5.0 guest operating system.

'''VMware Tools'''

Be sure to install VMware Tools in your guest operating system. For an overview of VMware Tools and for a listing of the manuals that contain instructions for installing VMware Tools in your guest, see knowledge base article 340 at [[http://kb.vmware.com/kb/340]].

__Do not start the X server in the guest operating system until you install VMware Tools.__
