Locking SpeedStep, PowerNow, or Cool'n'Quiet on the Host to a Constant Speed

Details

   How can I lock the processor speed on my laptop computer, which has a
   power management feature like SpeedStep, PowerNow, or Cool'n'Quiet?

Solution

   With certain VMware products, time and processor speed in a virtual
   machine are affected by the power management features, because they
   change the speed at which the computer's processor runs. That can cause
   inaccuracies in clocks and timers in the virtual machine and can also
   cause inaccurate readings of rated processor speed.

   To work around these problems, you may need to set the processor so it
   runs at a constant speed.

   With Workstation 4.0 and GSX Server 2.5.1 and later versions, you may
   be able to correct the clock timing without forcing the processor to
   run at a constant speed; see article 1227 (for Windows hosts) at
   www.vmware.com/support/kb/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1227 or article
   1591 (for Linux hosts) at
   www.vmware.com/support/kb/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1591 .

   On Windows hosts: Take the following steps before you start your VMware
   software. The following example uses SpeedStep as an example, but the
   process for PowerNow or Cool'n'Quiet is similar.
    1. On your Windows host system, in the Control Panel, double-click the
       Power Options icon. On Windows Server 2003 hosts (VMware GSX Server
       or Workstation) or Windows XP hosts (VMware Workstation only), you
       may need to click Classic View first.
    2. Click the Intel SpeedStep technology tab.
    3. Under Plugged in, select Maximum Performance.
    4. Under Running on batteries, select Maximum Performance.
    5. Click OK to close the SpeedStep dialog box.
    6. Reboot the host computer. This step ensures that your VMware
       software correctly detects the changed speed setting.

   When you are not running your VMware software, you may want to restore
   these settings to their previous values to extend battery life.

   Note: If there is no SpeedStep tab in the Power Options control panel,
   you may be able to add one by installing the proper driver. Go to the
   Web site of your computer's manufacturer and search for "Intel
   SpeedStep driver," "Intel SpeedStep applet" or "Intel SpeedStep
   application." If this software is available, install it on your host
   operating system. If no driver software is available for your host
   computer, you may find comparable configuration options in the
   computer's BIOS settings. See the steps for Linux hosts below for
   general guidelines on changing these settings.

   On Linux hosts: Set the appropriate options in the computer's BIOS. The
   details vary from one computer to another. The process is similar to
   that described in the following steps for SpeedStep:
    1. Shut down and reboot your host computer.
    2. While your host is rebooting, press the appropriate key to enter
       its BIOS setup screen.
    3. Navigate to the SpeedStep settings.
    4. Under Intel SpeedStep Technology, select Enabled.
    5. Under Power Mode for AC, select Maximum Performance.
    6. Under Power Mode for Battery, select Maximum Performance.
    7. Save the BIOS settings and exit.

   Also disable any known daemons that alter the CPU speed. Such daemons
   vary among different Linux operating systems. The most common ones are
   cpuspeed and cpufreqd.
