Host Power Management Causes Problems with Guest Timekeeping on Linux Hosts

Details

   I have a Linux host with power management features that vary the
   processor speed. When the host processor speed changes, the guest clock
   runs too quickly or too slowly. Can I correct this?

Solution

   This article applies to VMware Workstation 4.0 and higher, VMware GSX
   Server 2.5.1 and higher, and VMware Server 1.x running on Linux hosts.

   For these products on Windows hosts, see http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1227 .
   For earlier versions of these products, see http://kb.vmware.com/kb/
   708 and http://kb.vmware.com/kb/ 916 .

   This problem occurs because current VMware for Linux products do not
   have complete support for host power management features (such as Intel
   SpeedStep, or AMD PowerNow or Cool'n'Quiet) that vary the processor
   speed. This article gives one workaround that prevents guest clocks
   from running quickly and another that periodically corrects the time
   when guest clocks run slowly. Alternatively, for more accurate time,
   you can lock the host processor to a constant speed; see knowledge base
   articles 708 and 916 at the links above.

   To prevent guest clocks from running too quickly, specify the correct
   maximum host CPU speed in your global configuration file,
   /etc/vmware/config . If this file exists, edit it with a text editor,
   adding the lines described below. The file may not exist. If it does
   not exist, create it as a plain text file.

   The example presented here assumes that the host computer has a maximum
   speed of 1700MHz. The first line is the most important one. It should
   be your host computer's maximum speed in kHz -- that is, its speed in
   MHz times 1000, or its speed in GHz times 1000000. To find your actual
   host's maximum CPU speed, run cat /proc/cpuinfo and look for the line
   cpu MHz, which is your host's maximum CPU speed. Add the following
   lines to your global configuration file:
host.cpukHz = 1700000
host.noTSC = TRUE
ptsc.noTSC = TRUE

   To periodically correct the time (once per minute) when a guest clock
   runs slowly, VMware Tools must be installed in the guest. On the
   Options tab of VMware Tools in the guest, verify that Time
   synchronization between the virtual machine and the host operating
   system is selected.

   Note: If the problem is still not corrected, this may be addressed by
   disabling power management altogether. This can be done by adding
   apm=off to the boot entry of the host's /etc/grub.conf file.

   Note: If the problem is more widespread than just timekeeping and the
   virtual machine is simply running too slowly or quickly, and using
   apm=off is not sufficient, additionally add acpi=off noapic to the boot
   entry of the host's /etc/grub.conf file.
