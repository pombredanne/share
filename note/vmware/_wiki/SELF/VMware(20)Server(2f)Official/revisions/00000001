''Get Started with Virtualization Risk-Free''

Begin enjoying the benefits of ''server virtualization'' for free. __VMware Server is a ''hosted'' (相對於 ESXi 其 Hypervisor 的說法) virtualization platform that installs like an application on any existing server hardware and partitions a physical server into multiple virtual machines.__

 * http://www.vmware.com/products/esxi/[Learn more about VMware ESXi]
 * http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/[Upgrade to VMware vSphere] to gain all the benefits of VMware virtualization

=== Start Achieving the Benefits of Virtualization ===

The free VMware Server is based upon VMware’s proven http://www.vmware.com/virtualization/what-is-virtualization.html[virtualization technology]. With this robust yet easy to use software you can:

 * __Accelerate ''server provisioning'' (伺服器備援) by building a virtual machine once and deploying it multiple times__

 * Easily evaluate software in ready-to-run virtual machines without installation and configuration

 * __Simplify IT testing of patches, new applications and operating systems by allowing systems administrators to test in a secure virtual machine environment and be able to roll back to a clean state by using the snapshot feature__

 * __Re-host legacy operating systems such as Windows 2000, Windows NT Server 4.0 and Windows 2003 (這麼快就被視為 Legacy 了...) in a virtual machine running on new hardware and operating system__

 * Leverage pre-built, ready-to-run ''virtual appliances'' that include virtual hardware, operating system and application environments from the http://www.vmware.com/appliances/[Virtual Appliance Marketplace]

=== How Does VMware Server Work? ===

__Install and run VMware Server as an application on top of a host Windows or Linux operating system. A thin ''virtualization layer'' partitions the physical server so you can run multiple virtual machines simultaneously on a single server.__ Computing resources of the physical server are treated as a uniform pool of resources that can be allocated to virtual machines in a controlled manner.

__VMware Server isolates each virtual machine from its host and other virtual machines, leaving it unaffected if another virtual machine crashes. Your data does not leak across virtual machines and your applications can only communicate over configured network connections. VMware Server encapsulates a virtual machine environment as a set of files, which are easy to back-up, move and copy. (單一個 VM 的所有檔案都集中在同一個資料夾底下, 可以直接 Backup/Move/Copy, 管理起來比 !VirtualBox 方便多了)__

=== Try VMware Server as the First Step to VMware vSphere ===

Start with VMware Server now, knowing that your virtual machines can easily be migrated to VMware vSphere later. __VMware vSphere is the industry’s first ''cloud operating system'', transforming IT infrastructures into a ''private cloud''—a collection of internal clouds federated on-demand to external clouds—delivering IT infrastructure as an easily accessible service.__ Enable the next generation of flexible, reliable IT services with the efficiency and low cost of cloud computing—featuring uncompromising(不妥協的) control over service levels.

Get ready for a superior introductory experience to virtualization with this stable, easy-to-use hosted virtualization platform that supports a broad range of operating systems and hardware.

'''Key Features'''

 * Installs like an application, with simple, wizard-driven installation and virtual machine creation process

 * Includes a ''web based management interface'' with a simple, flexible, secure, intuitive and productive management experience

 * Runs on any standard x86 hardware, including Intel and AMD ''hardware virtualization assisted'' systems

 * Runs on a wider variety of Linux and Windows host and guest operating systems than any server virtualization product on the market

 * __Supports two-processor Virtual SMP, enabling a single virtual machine to span multiple physical processors__

 * Captures entire state of a virtual machine and rolls back at any time with the click of a single button

 * Protects investment with an easy virtual machine migration path to VMware Infrastructure

'''New Features in VMware Server 2'''

 * New operating system support: The broadest operating system support of any host-based virtualization platform currently available, including support for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista Business Edition and Ultimate Edition (guest only), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Ubuntu 8.04.

 * 64-bit operating system support: __Use 64-bit guest operating systems on 64-bit hardware to enable more scalable and higher performing computing solutions. (按照 FAQ 的說法, 64-bit Guest 的支援跟 Host OS 無關, 只跟 CPU 是否為 64-bit 有關) In addition, Server 2 will run natively on 64-bit Linux host operating systems.__

 * VMware Infrastructure (VI) Web Access management interface: VI Web Access management interface provides a simple, flexible, secure, intuitive and productive management experience. Plus, access thousands of pre-built, pre-configured, ready-to-run enterprise applications packaged with an operating system inside a virtual machine at the Virtual Appliance Marketplace.

 * Independent virtual machine console: With the new VMware Remote Console, you can access your virtual machine consoles independent of the VI Web Access management interface. (除了 Console 會開在新窗之外, 也可以從 VI Web Access 建立桌面捷徑, 之後不必先進入 VI Web Access, 就可以連線 Remote Console)

 * More scalable virtual machines: __Support for up to 8 GB of RAM and up to 10 virtual network interface cards per virtual machine, transfer data at faster data rates from USB 2.0 devices plus add new SCSI hard disks and controllers to a running virtual machine.__

 * Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS): __Properly backup the state of the Windows virtual machines when using the snapshot feature to maintain data integrity of the applications running inside the virtual machine.__

 * Support for Virtual Machine Interface (VMI): This feature enables transparent paravirtualization, in which a single binary version of the operating system can run either on native hardware or in ''paravirtualized mode'' to improve performance in specific Linux environments.

 * Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI): Support for fast and efficient communication between a virtual machine and the host operating system and between two or more virtual machines on the same host.

 * Support for VIX API 1.6: __This feature provides a programming interface for automating virtual machine and guest operations.__

=== What are the top three use cases for VMware Server? ===

VMware Server is typically used in the following scenarios:

 * Assessing virtualization for the 1st time
 * Evaluating software using virtual machines
 * Test and development of software and IT environments

=== How does VMware Server differ from VMware’s other free virtualization solution, VMware ESXi? ===

The table below highlights key differences between VMware Server and VMware ESXi.

|| || VMware Server || VMware ESXi ||

=== Can I install VMware Server 2 on a Core installation of Windows Server 2008 host operating system? ===

No, VMware Server 2 can only be installed on a Full installation of Windows Server 2008 host operating system. However, both Core and Full installations of Windows Server 2008 are supported as guest operating systems. (什麼是 Core Installation)

=== What does 64-bit operating system support mean? ===

__'''It means that 64-bit guest operating systems will run on supported 64-bit hardware independent of the type of host operating system.'''__

Refer to the following table for supported combinations.

(VMware Server 2 will also run natively on 64-bit Linux host operating systems.)

No, VMware Server 2 cannot be managed by VMware vCenter Server 2.5. __There are no centralized (multi-host) management options available for VMware Server 2.__

=== Should I run VMware Server 2 for production workloads? ===

__'''Yes, VMware Server 2 can be used for production workloads.''' VMware also provides other virtualization solutions such as VMware ESXi and VMware Infrastructure that provider higher performance, better scalability and automation capabilities.__

=== Can I upgrade to VMware Server 2 and reuse my existing serial numbers from VMware Server 1.0.x installation? ===

__Yes, you will be able to upgrade to VMware Server 2 and reuse existing serial numbers from VMware Server 1.0.x installations.__ This is true whether performing an upgrade on an existing VMware Server host or a new installation on a different host.

=== How do I ensure that new virtual machines created in Server 2 hosts can be successfully migrate to VMware ESX hosts? ===

__When creating new virtual machine in VI Web Access, expand the Product Compatibility option and select the setting to allow VMware ESX host compatibility. In addition, ensure that the virtual machine does not contain devices such as IDE hard disks and SCSI CD-ROM drive.__
