////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 * A web API is typically a defined set of HTTP request messages along with a definition of the structure of response messages, typically expressed in JSON or XML.
 * While "web API" is sometimes considered a synonym for web service, the Web 2.0 applications typically have moved away from SOAP-based web services towards more direct RESTful web resources.
 * Web APIs allow the combination of multiple services into new applications known as mashups.
 * authentication works differently, inbound traffic is often automated and response times need to be rapid for the API to be usable within another site - all a bit different from a standard web app.
 * API business
   ** for developers to access the service, manage their resource usage and track activity on the API
   ** 3scale's API management platform - handles signup keys, usage limits, traffic analysis and the documentation needed to support developers using the new API. For heavy users we can also add paid plans to cover any App Engine costs or make a small profit - 寫 API 也有賺錢的機會。
